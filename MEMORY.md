## Everclaw Skill (profbernardoj/everclaw)

### Current Version: v0.9.2
- OpenClaw skill for decentralized AI inference via Morpheus network
- Website: everclaw.xyz (GitHub Pages from docs/)
- Repo: profbernardoj/everclaw on GitHub

### Architecture
- **Morpheus proxy:** `~/morpheus/proxy/morpheus-proxy.mjs` (port 8083, launchd: com.morpheus.proxy)
- **Morpheus proxy-router (Go):** `~/morpheus/` (port 8082)
- **Proxy auth:** Bearer token `morpheus-local`
- **OpenClaw provider name:** `morpheus` (e.g., `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`)
- Venice IDs use hyphens (`kimi-k2-5`), Morpheus uses dots (`kimi-k2.5`)

### Fallback Chain
`venice/claude-opus-4-6` → `venice/claude-opus-45` → `venice/kimi-k2-5` → `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`

### Multi-Key Auth Rotation (v0.9.1)
- 6 Venice API keys configured as separate auth profiles (venice:key1 through venice:key6)
- Explicit rotation order via `auth.order.venice` in openclaw.json (most DIEM to least)
- Total DIEM: 246 (98+50+40+26+20+12)
- When one key's credits exhaust → billing disable on that profile only → rotates to next key
- Same model, fresh credits — agent stays on Claude instead of falling to cheaper models
- Only after ALL 6 keys are disabled does OpenClaw fall to model fallback chain (Morpheus)

### Model Router (v0.6)
- `scripts/router.mjs` — 13-dimension weighted prompt classifier, <1ms
- 3 tiers: LIGHT (glm-4.7-flash), STANDARD (kimi-k2.5), HEAVY (claude-opus-4-6)
- Reasoning override: 2+ keywords → force HEAVY
- Ambiguous → STANDARD (safe/free)

### x402 + ERC-8004 (v0.7 — shipped)
- `scripts/x402-client.mjs` — auto HTTP 402 payment flow, EIP-712 signing, USDC on Base
- `scripts/agent-registry.mjs` — reads ERC-8004 Identity + Reputation registries on Base
- Budget controls: $1/request, $10/day defaults
- Key contract addresses (same on all chains):
  - Identity: `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`
  - Reputation: `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`

### Morpheus API Gateway (v0.8 — shipped)
- Base URL: `https://api.mor.org/api/v1` (NOT `/v1` — needs `/api/v1`)
- OpenAI-compatible, 34 models, free beta until March 1 2026
- Provider name in OpenClaw: `mor-gateway`
- Community bootstrap key (SmartAgentProtocol): base64-obfuscated in `scripts/bootstrap-gateway.mjs`
- Session automation must be enabled at app.mor.org for each account
- Reminder set for Feb 22 re: March 1 beta expiry (cron ID: 9b7d448c)
- Purpose: eliminate need for Claude API key for new OpenClaw users — bootstrap with free Morpheus inference

### MOR Economics
- MOR is staked, not consumed — recycled after sessions close
- ~88 MOR in wallet, ~900+ staked in sessions, ~9,000 MOR in Safe
- Active session expires ~2026-02-18

## David's Model Preferences
- **DO NOT use:** llama-3.3-70b, deepseek-v3.2 as backup models
- Claude 4.6: complex reasoning only (expensive)
- Kimi K2.5: most cron/sub-agent work (free via Morpheus)
- GLM 4.7 Flash: trivial tasks (free, fast)
- All 10 isolated cron jobs use `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`

## Lessons Learned

### Morpheus models need reasoning: false in OpenClaw config (2026-02-11)
All Morpheus provider models (kimi-k2.5, kimi-k2-thinking, glm-4.7-flash) must have `"reasoning": false` in openclaw.json. The upstream litellm rejects the `reasoning_effort` parameter — if set to true, cron jobs using Morpheus models fail with HTTP 400. Fixed via config.patch.

### Morpheus Proxy Error Classification (2026-02-11)
Morpheus infrastructure failures (502s) must return `type: "server_error"` not `"billing"` — otherwise OpenClaw triggers extended cooldown and cascades across all providers.

### Sub-agent Task Complexity (2026-02-11)
Kimi K2.5 via sub-agent choked on complex multi-file coding task (2s exit, no output). Heavy coding work should stay on Claude. This validates the HEAVY tier in the router.

### ERC-8004 Contract Quirks (2026-02-11)
- `totalSupply()` not available on Identity Registry — use binary search via `ownerOf()`
- Registration files often stored as base64 `data:application/json;base64,...` URIs on-chain
- Same contract addresses deployed across all EVM chains

### ClawRouter Evaluation (2026-02-11)
Rejected BlockRunAI/ClawRouter: routes through BlockRun API (middleman), plaintext wallet keys, no Venice/Morpheus models. Extracted scoring concept (MIT) but built custom system.

### Gateway Guardian: HTTP healthy ≠ inference healthy (2026-02-12)
Guardian v1 only probed HTTP (gateway dashboard). Real failure: gateway alive but ALL providers in cooldown = brain-dead. Fix: probe providers directly (Venice `/api/v1/models`, Morpheus `/health`, mor-gateway). Restarting gateway clears in-memory cooldown state. Nuclear option: `curl install.sh | bash`.

### openclaw agent CLI needs --to or --session-id (2026-02-12)
Can't use `openclaw agent --message` headless without specifying a target. Direct provider HTTP probes are better for health checks — simpler, faster, no auth needed.

### Venice DIEM credits (2026-02-12)
Venice uses "DIEM" as credit unit (1:1 USD). When exhausted, returns billing errors. Credits appear to reset daily. Claude Opus 4.6 burns through them fast ($6/M input, $30/M output in DIEM).

## SmartAgentProtocol (GitHub Org)
- Org: https://github.com/orgs/SmartAgentProtocol
- Role: admin/owner (profbernardoj)
- Description: "Open Source Chat Interface For Wallets, Dapps, DAOs, & Smart Contracts"
- **Vision:** Full version of OpenClaw with Everclaw improvements, packaged for non-technical users
- **Workflow:** PRs, code review, CI testing — higher bar than Everclaw's direct-push model
- **Target users:** People not comfortable with Terminal — needs GUI installer / one-click setup
- **Starting Feb 12, 2026**
