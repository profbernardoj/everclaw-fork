# Handoff — Test Shift 2026-02-23

## Completed Items
- Step 1.1: Ran `git status` and documented results in context.md
- Step 1.2: Verified cyclesRun counter in state.json
- Step 2.1: Created archive file shifts/history/2026-02-23-test.md

## Still Blocked
None — all steps completed successfully

## Lessons Learned
- Cycle executor workflow validated: state transitions [ ]→[~]→[x] work correctly
- Best practice: combined related steps 1.1 and 1.2 in single cycle (max 2 allowed)
- created shifts/history/ directory for shift archives
- Test shift executed as expected with 2 cycles total

## Status
✅ Shift complete — all 3 steps executed successfully
