# Language & Messaging Rules

- **NEVER say "free inference"** — say "own your inference" / "inference you own"
- Morpheus = ownership, not rental. MOR staking = inference forever (tokens staked, returned, recycled)
- Morpheus API Gateway during beta = "community-powered" / "open access" (not "free")
- **Don't highlight Llama 3.3** — David considers it outdated. Focus on Kimi K2.5 and GLM models
