# What's Still Important in the Age of AI — Balaji Srinivasan

**Source:** @balajis on X (captured 2026-02-11)
**Author:** Balaji Srinivasan — founder of Network School, author of *The Network State*
**Relevance:** Family First (raising children with these skills), Abolition of the State (Network State as voluntary alternative to nation-states)

## David's Context

This is important for both how David raises his children (directing them into learning focused on these skills and values) and for understanding Balaji's Network State concept — one of the primary paths to achieving the "abolition of the state" life goal. A Network State is a voluntary smart contract between people with free choice, replacing the nation-state model where force creates government monopoly.

## The Quote

> What's still important in the age of AI?
>
> **Vision** and **verification**. **Prompting** and **polishing**. **Community** and **geography**. **Scarcity** and **cryptography**. **Physicality** and **resiliency**.
>
> **Vision** is where you are going. AI can move fast in a direction but it needs direction. Vision means focusing on that direction.
>
> **Verification** is making sure the AI is doing what you want it to do. You can use AIs to critique each other, but you are the final critic.
>
> **Prompting** is articulating what you want in clear written (or spoken) English. Those with great vocabularies will do far better than those without.
>
> **Polishing** is realizing that AI often does it middle-to-middle, but not end-to-end. AI is a construction crane that can build much of the building, but often at the end you need human tweezers.
>
> **Community** is online and offline connectivity. It's what stays roughly constant even as software becomes variable.
>
> **Geography** is the longitude and latitude that governs your laws. To first order the Internet is roughly uniform across the surface of the earth, but to second order it really is not.
>
> **Scarcity** is everything from physical scarcity (like robots and drones and houses and cars) to distribution scarcity. The hard-to-make atoms as distinct from the easily made bits.
>
> **Cryptography** is everything AI can't do. LLMs can solve partial differential equations, but not discrete logarithms. The hard-to-fake bits as distinct from the easily faked bits.
>
> **Physicality** is where AI will truly shine. Robot task completions can often be more easily verified. The real world is the verifier of whether a box is on a table. It's much harder to verify whether an essay is done.
>
> **Resiliency** is about cutting your burn rate, strengthening your community, and picking the right location (and allocation) to weather the dislocations ahead.

## The 10 Skills (Summary)

1. **Vision** — Direction-setting, knowing where you're going
2. **Verification** — Being the final critic of AI output
3. **Prompting** — Clear articulation, vocabulary, precise language
4. **Polishing** — End-to-end finishing that AI can't do
5. **Community** — Human connectivity (online + offline)
6. **Geography** — Physical location still matters for law and opportunity
7. **Scarcity** — Physical goods, atoms > bits
8. **Cryptography** — The one thing AI provably can't break
9. **Physicality** — Real-world verification is easier than abstract verification
10. **Resiliency** — Low burn rate, strong community, right location
