## GLM-5 vs MiniMax-M2.5 Research & Testing

David asked to evaluate GLM-5 and MiniMax-M2.5 as Kimi K2.5 replacements.

### Benchmark Research (Feb 2026)
- **GLM-5** (Zhipu, 744B/40B active MoE): Reasoning king — AIME 92.7%, GPQA 86%, HLE 50.4 (beats Opus 4.5), lowest hallucination rate in industry, SWE-Bench 77.8%
- **MiniMax-M2.5** (230B/10B active MoE): Coding king — SWE-Bench 80.2% (~Opus 4.6 level), BFCL tool-calling 76.8%, extremely fast (100 TPS Lightning), 1/20th Claude's cost

### Live Testing Results
- **GLM-5 via local Morpheus**: All tasks passed (reasoning, complex coding, smart contract audit, bash scripting). 6-35s per task. Production-quality outputs.
- **MiniMax-M2.5**: Works on Venice (`minimax-m25`) but has severe latency issues — multi-task prompts timeout, streaming mode broken, mor-gateway completely unresponsive tonight. Single-task prompts work at ~6-17s.
- **mor-gateway** (`api.mor.org`): Was completely down/unresponsive for all models during testing

### Decision: GLM-5 as default
- Router updated to open-source-first design
- STANDARD tier: `morpheus/glm-5` (replaces `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`)
- HEAVY tier: `morpheus/glm-5` primary, `venice/claude-opus-4-6` fallback only
- Committed and pushed to everclaw repo

### Next Steps
- Migrate cron jobs from kimi-k2.5 to glm-5
- Consider adding MiniMax-M2.5 to local Morpheus proxy when blockchain model ID becomes available
- Monitor GLM-5 reliability over next few days as default
