## GLM-5 vs MiniMax-M2.5 Research & Testing

David asked to evaluate GLM-5 and MiniMax-M2.5 as Kimi K2.5 replacements.

### Benchmark Research (Feb 2026)
- **GLM-5** (Zhipu, 744B/40B active MoE): Reasoning king — AIME 92.7%, GPQA 86%, HLE 50.4 (beats Opus 4.5), lowest hallucination rate in industry, SWE-Bench 77.8%
- **MiniMax-M2.5** (230B/10B active MoE): Coding king — SWE-Bench 80.2% (~Opus 4.6 level), BFCL tool-calling 76.8%, extremely fast (100 TPS Lightning), 1/20th Claude's cost

### Live Testing Results
- **GLM-5 via local Morpheus**: All tasks passed (reasoning, complex coding, smart contract audit, bash scripting). 6-35s per task. Production-quality outputs.
- **MiniMax-M2.5**: Works on Venice (`minimax-m25`) but has severe latency issues — multi-task prompts timeout, streaming mode broken, mor-gateway completely unresponsive tonight. Single-task prompts work at ~6-17s.
- **mor-gateway** (`api.mor.org`): Was completely down/unresponsive for all models during testing

### Decision: GLM-5 as default
- Router updated to open-source-first design
- STANDARD tier: `morpheus/glm-5` (replaces `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`)
- HEAVY tier: `morpheus/glm-5` primary, `venice/claude-opus-4-6` fallback only
- Committed and pushed to everclaw repo

### Next Steps
- Migrate cron jobs from kimi-k2.5 to glm-5
- Consider adding MiniMax-M2.5 to local Morpheus proxy when blockchain model ID becomes available
- Monitor GLM-5 reliability over next few days as default

## Everclaw v0.9.8 Release & ClawHub Trust Score (continued, ~12:00 CST)

### Scoble Report
- Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer, 560k followers) posted a massive OpenClaw intelligence report — 98 real-world use cases compiled by @blevlabs' AI reading Scoble's X lists via xAI API
- Tweet went viral: 1,000+ likes, 2,267 bookmarks, 112K views
- Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcSttZY0l9et4tBjZg2BT5moehjDnFj72cz1ev-ZV14
- Report mentions GLM-5/MiniMax M2.5 support, detailed setup guides, OpenClaw at 167k+ GitHub stars

### Family Notes from Scoble Report
- **WHOOP fitness integration**: David + Cayla plan to get WHOOP devices. Noted for family fitness goals — explore OpenClaw + WHOOP dashboard (report use case #50)
- **Family AI Hub**: David plans individual OpenClaw agents for Cayla, Savannah, Sydney, Sofia, Daniel, and Leia. Updated memory/goals/great-commission-family.md

### ClawHub Trust Score Issue
- Everclaw shows as "Suspicious" on ClawHub (VirusTotal Code Insight flag)
- Likely triggers: wallet/keychain private key retrieval, base64-encoded API keys, curl/exec patterns in scripts, bundled security skill pattern definitions
- Filed GitHub issue: openclaw/openclaw#17220 requesting review
- Two appeal paths: GitHub issue (done) + email security@openclaw.ai (David approved sending)
- ClawHub still showing v0.9.7 — David approved publishing v0.9.8

### Completed Actions
- [x] Email sent to security@openclaw.ai from BernardoJohnston@proton.me — "False positive VirusTotal flag on everclaw-inference skill (ClawHub)" — sent 12:05 PM CST
- [x] GitHub issue filed: openclaw/openclaw#17220

### Pending Actions
- [ ] Publish v0.9.8 to ClawHub — rate limited on first attempt, need to retry later
- [ ] Monitor for response from security@openclaw.ai or GitHub issue #17220
