## Revealed Preferences: What Users Actually Want

### 1. 🤖 AI/ML Self-Improvement is #1 Desire
**Top 2 skills by downloads are AI/ML: Capability Evolver (35K) + self-improving-agent (16K)**

Users want agents that can:
- Evolve their own capabilities
- Self-improve autonomously
- Extend their own functionality

**Inference Implication:** These skills likely make heavy API calls to iterate on prompts, test capabilities, and run evaluation loops. This means **high token volume** for reasoning and code generation.

### 2. 🛠️ Tooling & Automation is Strong
- **Wacli (16K)** + **ByteRover (16K)** + **ATXP (14K)** = 46K+ downloads
- Users want agents to execute commands, manage files, automate workflows

**Inference Implication:** Code generation, command synthesis, file operations → strong demand for **fast, cheap inference** for utility tasks.

### 3. 🌐 Web Automation is Critical
- **Agent Browser (11K)** + **Tavily Web Search (8K)** = 20K+ downloads
- Web scraping, search, browsing automation

**Inference Implication:** Web automation requires models good at:
- Understanding page structure
- Synthesizing actions
- Parsing results
→ Mix of **fast cheap models for simple extraction** + **smart models for complex reasoning**

### 4. 📊 Summarization & Content Processing
- **Summarize (11K)** + **Humanize AI text (9K)** = 20K+ downloads
- Users process a lot of content

**Inference Implication:** High volume of **long-context requests**. Users want to compress articles, transcriptions, documents. Models with large context windows and fast processing are key.

## Inference Demand Profile (for Morpheus Gateway)

Based on revealed preferences:

| Use Case | Demand Level | Model Requirements |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Self-improvement loops | Very High | Reasoning models, extended thinking |
| Code generation | High | Smart code models, fast response |
| Web automation | High | Mixed (smart for planning, fast for extraction) |
| Summarization | High | Large context, fast processing |
| Utility tasks | Medium | Fast, cheap models |
| Content humanization | Medium | Style transfer, creative models |

### Key Insight for Kyle

**The top skill is "Capability Evolver"** — users want agents that can autonomously improve themselves. This implies:
1. Recursive inference (agents calling inference to improve inference)
2. High token volume for experimentation/iteration
3. Need for both smart reasoning models AND cheap fast models

The **self-improving-agent** skill has the **highest star count (132)** — strong community endorsement that this is the direction agents should go.

## Security Note (Context)

ClawHub had a security incident ("ClawHavoc", Feb 2026):
- 341 malicious skills discovered (data theft)
- 283 skills with critical flaws (7.1%)
- Registry reduced from 5,705 → 3,286 skills
- VirusTotal partnership added for scanning
- Auto-hide after 3 reports

This validates the need for **skillguard** and security scanning when installing skills.
