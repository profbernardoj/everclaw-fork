## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You're tracking stocks across three brokerages, crypto in two wallets, and news from a dozen sources. Research is scattered across browser tabs, notes apps, and spreadsheets. Earnings season is a firehose. And you're pretty sure you missed that opportunity last week.

### The Solution
**InvestClaw: Your intelligent investment companion.**

- Unified portfolio tracking across all accounts and asset classes
- Research organization with AI-powered summarization
- Earnings call analysis and key takeaway extraction
- Price alerts and opportunity identification
- Runs locally — your financial data stays private

### The Hook
> *"Smarter investing starts with organized intelligence."*
