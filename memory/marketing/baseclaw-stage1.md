# BaseClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Base chain users, Coinbase ecosystem users, L2 enthusiasts, "onchain summer" participants

**Demographics:**
- Age: 20-40
- Technical: Moderate to high (comfortable with L2s, bridging, DeFi on Base)
- Values: Fast transactions, low fees, Coinbase trust, mainstream crypto adoption
- Pain points: Fragmented L2 landscape, connecting Coinbase to DeFi, keeping up with Base ecosystem growth

**Psychographic Profile:**
- Started on Coinbase, graduated to onchain
- Active in Base ecosystem (Aerodrome, Moonwell, other Base-native protocols)
- Excited about "bringing the next billion onchain"
- Values mainstream adoption and UX over maximalism
- Active on X, Farcaster, Discord

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You discovered Base. Now you have tokens scattered across Aerodrome, Moonwell,clamp, and twelve more protocols. Coinbase made crypto simple. Onchain made it complicated again.

### The Solution
**BaseClaw: Your Base chain companion.**

- Track every position in the Base ecosystem
- Bridge from Ethereum and other L2s seamlessly
- Never miss a Base-native airdrop
- Connect your Coinbase account for a unified view
- Run locally — your keys, your data, your Base

### The Hook
> *"Coinbase made crypto accessible. BaseClaw makes onchain livable."*

**Subhead:** Track, bridge, and automate your Base ecosystem portfolio. Coinbase-simple. Onchain-powerful.

**CTA:** [Launch Agent] [Explore Features]

### Problem Section
**Headline:** Onchain is Supposed to Be Easy

**Body:**
- 50+ protocols on Base and growing
- Bridging between chains is still confusing
- Missed the Aerodrome airdrop? You're not alone
- Coinbase shows your balance, but not your DeFi positions

### How It Works
1. **Connect** — Coinbase wallet, Base addresses, or both
2. **Sync** — BaseClaw indexes your entire Base footprint
3. **Discover** — Find protocols you didn't know you needed
4. **Automate** — Bridging, staking, claiming on autopilot
5. **Own it** — Runs locally, your keys, your privacy
