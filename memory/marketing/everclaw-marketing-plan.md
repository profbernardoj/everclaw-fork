# EverClaw 28 Flavors Marketing Plan

**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Status:** Actionable

---

## ExecutiveSummary

**Goal:** Drive users through the ownership funnel — from discovery → VM setup → inference → hardware → full ownership.

**Core Message:** "Own your AI agent. Hardware, data, inference — all yours."

**Differentiator:** Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, or other centralized AI:
- You hold the private key
- You own your data
- You control your agent's values and alignment
- Inference never runs out (MOR staking = perpetual)
