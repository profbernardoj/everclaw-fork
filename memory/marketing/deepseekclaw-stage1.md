## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
DeepSeek offers incredible value — GPT-4-class performance at a fraction of the cost. But tracking usage, managing budgets, comparing with alternatives, and knowing when to use DeepSeek vs. other models — that's still manual. You chose DeepSeek for savings. Now save time too.

### The Solution
**DeepSeekClaw: Your cost-conscious AI companion.**

- Track DeepSeek usage and costs in real-time
- Compare DeepSeek against alternatives on cost and quality
- Route requests to the most cost-effective model
- Manage prompts and experiments across providers
- Run locally — your API keys, your budget, your control

### The Hook
> *"DeepSeek for quality. DeepSeekClaw for efficiency."*
