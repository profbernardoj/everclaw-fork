# LlamaClaw Marketing Plan — Stage 2: Content & Messaging Strategy

**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Flavor:** LlamaClaw (llamaclaw.com)
**Target:** Open weights advocates, Llama users, open source AI community

---

## Core Value Proposition

### Primary Positioning
**"Open weights. Open tooling. Open future."**

LlamaClaw is the AI agent for Llama users — model tracking, benchmark comparisons, hardware optimization, and fine-tuning management.

### Value Proposition Statement
> 12+ Llama variants. Benchmarks scattered across papers. Hardware optimization by trial and error. You chose open weights for control. Where's the control?
> 
> Connect LlamaClaw and get an AI that:
> - Tracks every Llama release, variant, and fine-tune
> - Compares benchmarks across models and quantization levels
> - Optimizes for your specific hardware configuration
> - Manages fine-tuning workflows and experiments
> - Runs locally — your models, your hardware, your control

### Taglines

| Tagline | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| "Open weights. Open tooling. Open future." | Primary |
| "Your open weights operations center." | Direct |
| "For those who run their own models." | Community |
| "Llama deserves better tooling." | Advocacy |
| "Own your AI. End to end." | Ownership |

## X/Twitter Content Strategy

### Account Setup
- **Handle:** @LlamaClaw
- **Bio:** "AI for Llama users. Model tracking. Benchmarks. Hardware optimization. llamaclaw.com"
- **Profile Image:** LlamaClaw logo (open source aesthetic)
- **Header:** Llama/model visualization

### Posting Cadence
- **3-4 posts per day**
- **Best times:** 9 AM - 12 PM EST, 2-5 PM EST, 7-9 PM EST
- **Focus:** Open source, benchmarks, hardware, community

### Content Pillars

#### Pillar 1: Model Tracking (25%)
New releases, variants, fine-tunes, capabilities.

#### Pillar 2: Benchmarks (30%)
Performance comparisons, quantization effects, task-specific rankings.

#### Pillar 3: Hardware Optimization (25%)
GPU selection, quantization strategies, inference optimization.

#### Pillar 4: Community (20%)
Open source advocacy, Hugging Face updates, contributor spotlights.

### Sample Tweets

**Model:**
> Llama 3.3 70B? Llama 4? Llama fine-tune #47?
> 
> Track every variant. Compare capabilities. Know what to run.
> 
> llamaclaw.com

**Benchmark:**
> "Which quantization for my 3090?"
> 
> → trial and error
> 
> → LlamaClaw: "Q4_K_M fits. Here's the benchmark hit."
> 
> Hardware optimization, solved.

**Open Source:**
> "Why run your own models?"
> 
> → Control
> → Privacy
> → No API limits
> → Open source values
> 
> LlamaClaw. For those who agree.

**Community:**
> New Llama fine-tune dropped on Hugging Face.
> 
> Performance: Better than base on [task]
> 
> LlamaClaw tracked it so you don't have to.
