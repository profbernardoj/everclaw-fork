## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You have accountants, lawyers, investment advisors, estate planners — each with their own systems. Your family's financial life is scattered across dozens of advisors and hundreds of documents. Succession planning is a folder no one opens. And every piece of software wants your family's data in their cloud.

### The Solution
**FamilyOfficeClaw: Your family's intelligence center.**

- Centralized view of family assets, advisors, and entities
- Document organization and retrieval across generations
- Succession and estate planning coordination
- Family governance and meeting management
- Runs locally — your family's most sensitive data stays in your control

### The Hook
> *"The family office that runs on your terms. Not theirs."*
