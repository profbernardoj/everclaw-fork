**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Venture capitalists, angel investors, VCs, deal flow managers, investment associates

**Demographics:**
- Age: 28-55
- Technical: Moderate to high (comfortable with deal flow tools, CRMs, data analysis)
- Values: Deal flow quality, founder vetting, market intelligence, network leverage
- Pain points: Deal flow overload, founder research, competitive intelligence, portfolio tracking

**Psychographic Profile:**

- Values time efficiency and information synthesis
- Network-driven but needs AI leverage

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You see 100+ decks a week. Each one needs founder research, market analysis, competitive landscape, reference calls. Associates are drowning in due diligence. Portfolio companies need attention. And you're pretty sure that founder's last startup wasn't actually "successful."

### The Solution
**VCIClaw: Your venture intelligence assistant.**

- Founder background research and verification
- Market and competitive landscape synthesis
- Deal memo generation and portfolio tracking
- Reference call prep and synthesis
- Runs locally — your deal flow data stays confidential

### The Hook
> *"See 100 deals. Know 100 stories. Decide in minutes."*
