**Demographics:**
- Age: 22-45
- Technical: Moderate to high (comfortable with AI APIs, model selection)
- Values: Cost efficiency, multilingual capabilities, performance-per-dollar
- Pain points: Model comparison, Chinese language support, integration complexity, workflow organization

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "Good AI shouldn't cost a fortune" mindset

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
MiniMax delivers impressive performance at competitive prices. But managing model selection, tracking usage costs, comparing with alternatives, and organizing your AI workflows — that's still manual. Great models deserve great tooling.

### The Solution
**MiniMaxClaw: Your MiniMax operations center.**

- Track usage, costs, and performance across MiniMax models
- Compare MiniMax against alternatives (GPT, Claude, Llama, Kimi)
- Manage prompts, responses, and experiments
- Optimize for cost-performance tradeoffs
- Run locally — your API keys, your data, your privacy

### The Hook
> *"Great models. Smart tooling. Better results."*
