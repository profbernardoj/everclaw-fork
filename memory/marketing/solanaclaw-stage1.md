# SolanaClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** SOL holders, Solana ecosystem users, "Solana summer" believers, high-speed DeFi traders

**Demographics:**
- Age: 18-40
- Technical: Moderate to high (comfortable with Solana wallets, DEXs, NFT minting)
- Values: Speed, low fees, consumer apps, mainstream adoption
- Pain points: RPC latency, wallet fragmentation, tracking DeFi across 100+ protocols, NFT portfolio chaos

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "Ethereum is too slow/expensive" mindset
- Active in Solana DeFi (Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, Kamino)
- NFT collectors and traders (Tensor, Magic Eden)
- Excited about consumer crypto (payments, social, gaming)
- Highly active on X during bull markets

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Solana is fast. Your portfolio tracking isn't. You've got SPL tokens scattered across Jupiter, Raydium, Kamino, and twelve lending protocols. NFTs in six wallets. Stake in four validators. And RPC nodes that time out when you need them most.

### The Solution
**SolanaClaw: Your high-speed onchain companion.**

- Track every SPL token, stake account, and DeFi position
- Real-time portfolio across 100+ Solana protocols
- NFT collection management and floor tracking
- Validator performance monitoring and staking optimization
- Run locally — your RPC, your keys, your Solana

### The Hook
> *"Solana moves fast. Your agent should too."*
