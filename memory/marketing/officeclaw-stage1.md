## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Your workday is a mess of meetings, emails, Slack messages, and documents. Task lists scattered across apps. Important files you can't find. Meetings you forgot to prep for. You spend more time *coordinating* work than *doing* it.

### The Solution
**OfficeClaw: Your workplace companion.**

- Calendar intelligence and meeting prep
- Task consolidation across all your apps
- Document management and search
- Communication summaries and action items
- Runs locally — your work data stays private

### The Hook
> *"Work smarter. Not harder."*
