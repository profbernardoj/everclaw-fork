## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Your trip is scattered across 5 confirmation emails, 3 booking apps, and a spreadsheet you haven't updated since January. You forgot the hotel address, can't find your confirmation number, and just realized your flight is tomorrow — at 6 AM.

### The Solution
**BookingClaw: Your intelligent travel companion.**

- Unified itinerary across all bookings
- Smart recommendations based on your destination
- Travel document organization and access
- Proactive alerts and reminders
- Runs locally — your travel data stays private

### The Hook
> *"Travel should be an adventure. Not a spreadsheet."*
