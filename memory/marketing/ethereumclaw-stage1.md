# EthereumClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** ETH holders, DeFi power users, Ethereum maximalists, "ultra sound money" believers

**Demographics:**
- Age: 22-45
- Technical: High (comfortable with smart contracts, staking, Layer 2s, DeFi protocols)
- Values: Decentralization, programmability, composability, open finance
- Pain points: Too many protocols to track, complex tax reporting, airdrop farming exhaustion, governance fatigue

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "Ether is sound money" mindset
- Active in DeFi (lending, DEXs, yield farming)
- Intrigued by AI but skeptical of centralized control
- Values composability and building on top of existing primitives
- Active on X, Farcaster, during bull markets

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Ethereum gave you programmable money. Now you have 47 tabs open tracking staking rewards, DeFi positions, governance proposals, and airdrop eligibility. Your "sound money" is giving you spreadsheet fatigue.

### The Solution
**EthereumClaw: Your onchain operations center.**

- Track every DeFi position across every chain
- Automate routine operations (claim rewards, restake, rebalance)
- Never miss an airdrop again
- Monitor governance proposals that matter to you
- Run locally — your RPC calls, your keys, your privacy

### The Hook
> *"Ethereum made money programmable. EthereumClaw makes it manageable."*

### Problem Section
**Headline:** The DeFi Dilemma

**Body:**

2. **EthereumClaw indexes** your onchain history
3. **Get insights** — positions, airdrops, governance, risks

5. **Own it forever** — runs on your hardware, your keys
