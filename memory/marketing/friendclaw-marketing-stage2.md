# FriendClaw Marketing Plan — Stage 2: Content & Messaging Strategy

**Created:** 2026-02-19
**Flavor:** FriendClaw (friendclaw.com)
**Target:** Social connectors, people who want help staying in touch

## Core Value Proposition

### Primary Positioning
**"Be the friend who remembers. Not the friend who forgets."**

FriendClaw is the AI assistant for relationships — birthday reminders, reach-out nudges, conversation starters, and relationship memory.

### Value Proposition Statement
> You have 200+ friends on social media. You talk to 5 of them. Birthdays slip by. "We should catch up" becomes "it's been 3 years."
> 
> Connect FriendClaw and get an AI that:
> - Remembers birthdays, anniversaries, important dates
> - Nudges you to reach out to friends you haven't talked to
> - Generates conversation starters based on their interests and your history
> - Tracks relationships like you track everything else
> - Runs locally — your social life is nobody else's business

### Taglines

| Tagline | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| "Be the friend who remembers. Not the friend who forgets." | Primary |
| "Your relationship memory." | Direct |
| "Never miss a birthday. Never lose touch." | Feature |
| "Friendship, remembered." | Emotional |
| "The friend you want to be." | Aspiration |
