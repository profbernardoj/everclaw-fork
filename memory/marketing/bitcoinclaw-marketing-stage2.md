### X Post Templates

#### Template A: Sovereignty Posts
```
Bitcoiners don't trust banks.

But they trust AI companies with their financial data?

BitcoinClaw runs on YOUR machine. Nothing leaves.

Your Bitcoin. Your data. Your sovereignty.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]
```

#### Template B: Pain Point Posts
```
Your seed phrase is written on paper.

Your wife doesn't know where it is.

Your kids have no idea you have Bitcoin.

Your inheritance plan is "hope nothing happens to me."

There's a better way.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]
```

#### Template C: Tax Season Posts
```
Tax season as a Bitcoiner:

• Export CSV from 3 exchanges
• Find your cold wallet addresses
• Calculate cost basis across 47 transactions
• Realize you lost records from 2021
• Cry

Or: BitcoinClaw does it automatically.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]
```

#### Template D: Security Audit Posts
```
How secure is your Bitcoin setup?

✓ Seed phrase: Where?
✓ Hardware wallet: Which one?
✓ Multi-sig: Set up?
✓ Inheritance: Planned?
✓ Family: Knows what to do?

BitcoinClaw audits your stack in 5 minutes.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]
```

#### Template E: Educational Posts
```
On-chain fees are confusing.

"What fee should I use?"

BitcoinClaw checks mempool, estimates confirmation time, and recommends the optimal fee for your urgency.

Never overpay. Never wait too long.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]
```

#### Template F: Inheritance Posts
```
You're holding Bitcoin for the next generation.

But they don't know:
• That you have it
• Where your seed phrase is
• How to access it
• What to do when you're gone

BitcoinClaw helps you build a real inheritance plan.

Your stack survives you.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]
```

#### Template G: Quote-Tweet Strategy
```
[Quote-tweet @saylor or @jack or major Bitcoin account]
"This is exactly why we built BitcoinClaw — to help Bitcoin holders truly own their sovereignty from security to inheritance.

Your Bitcoin. Your AI. Your rules.

[bitcoinclaw.ai]"
```

#### Template H: Technical Posts
```
UTXO management. Coin selection. Fee optimization.

Most Bitcoiners ignore these until it costs them.

BitcoinClaw explains on-chain concepts and helps you optimize your stack.

Learn by doing.

### X Engagement Protocol

**Daily Tasks:**
1. Check #Bitcoin and #BitcoinOnly for engagement opportunities

3. Reply to questions about security, inheritance, taxes with helpful advice (don't spam link)
4. Engage with Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey, Lyn Alden, Matt Odell posts

**Weekly Tasks:**
1. Thread: "This week in Bitcoin security" (tips, news, BitcoinClaw features)

- **Lightning Address:** Set up for Zaps (tips)

### Nostr Engagement Approach
- More casual, more authentic than Twitter
- Zap (tip) good content with satoshis
- Build relationships with influential Bitcoiners
- Share educational content
- Nostr values: sovereignty, privacy, Bitcoin-only

### Nostr Content Style
- Longer-form thoughts (no character limit)
- Technical deep-dives do well
- Privacy and self-custody content resonates
- Community participation > broadcasting

## Reddit Strategy

### r/Bitcoin Posting Strategy

**Reddit Rules to Follow:**
- 10:1 ratio (10 non-promotional contributions per promotional post)
- No astroturfing (be transparent about affiliation)
- Contribute value first

### Reddit Post Templates

#### "Show and Tell" Post
**Title:** [Discussion] I built an AI tool for Bitcoin holders - would love feedback from the community

**Body:**
```
Hey r/Bitcoin,

Long-time Bitcoiner here (self-custody since 2017, node runner since 2019). I've been building something to solve some pain points I've had, and wanted to share it with this community.

**The Problem:**
- Security audits are manual and easy to get wrong
- Tax tracking across wallets is a nightmare
- Inheritance planning is something we all know we need but never do
- On-chain data is hard to interpret

**What I Built:**
BitcoinClaw - an AI agent that runs locally on your machine and helps with:
- Security audit of your setup
- Cost basis tracking for taxes
- On-chain analysis (mempool, fees, UTXOs)
- Inheritance planning guides
- Family onboarding assistance

**Why Local:**
Your wallet data never leaves your machine. This is AI that respects Bitcoin values - sovereignty, privacy, trustlessness.

**Demo video:** [link]

I'm not here to sell anything - just wanted feedback from Bitcoiners on whether this is useful. Happy to answer questions about the tech stack or approach.

Technical details:
- Self-hosted (runs on Linux, Mac, Windows)
- No cloud dependency
- Connects to your node via RPC (or uses public nodes)
- 5-minute setup

What do you think? What features would make this actually useful for you?
```

#### Response Template (for questions about security)
```
Great question. BitcoinClaw never asks for your seed phrase or private keys.

It connects to your node via RPC (read-only) to analyze:
• UTXOs and addresses
• Transaction history (for tax tracking)
• Mempool data (for fee estimation)

For hardware wallets: It can read public keys via HWI (Hardware Wallet Interface) to show balances and addresses, but never has signing capability.

For inheritance planning: It guides you through creating documents and multi-sig setups, but you execute everything on your hardware wallet.

The principle: BitcoinClaw helps you understand and manage, but never holds or moves your Bitcoin.
```

### r/BitcoinEngagement Strategy
- Answer questions about self-custody, security, taxes
- Share educational content (not always promotional)
- Participate in inheritance planning discussions
- Be a helpful community member first

### Outreach Email Template
```
Subject: BitcoinClaw - AI for Bitcoin Holders (would love your thoughts)

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work for years — your [specific video/episode] really helped me understand [topic].

I wanted to reach out because I've built something for Bitcoin holders:

BitcoinClaw - an AI agent that runs locally and helps with security audits, tax tracking, inheritance planning, and on-chain analysis.

**Why I think it matters:**
- Bitcoiners need tools that respect sovereignty
- Everything runs locally — no data leaves your machine
- Focused on self-custody, not trading or speculation

**The problem it solves:**
- Security audits are manual
- Tax tracking across wallets is a nightmare
- Inheritance planning is overlooked
- On-chain data is hard to interpret

Would you be open to taking a look? I'd value your feedback on whether this is actually useful for Bitcoiners.

No pressure either way — just wanted to put it on your radar.

Thanks for everything you do for the Bitcoin community.

[Your Name]
[bitcoinclaw.ai]
