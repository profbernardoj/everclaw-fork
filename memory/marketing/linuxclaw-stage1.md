# LinuxClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Linux power users, server administrators, self-hosters, open source advocates

**Demographics:**
- Age: 22-50
- Technical: High (comfortable with Linux, servers, command line, self-hosting)
- Values: Open source, self-hosting, privacy, control, Unix philosophy
- Pain points: AI tools that require cloud, lack of Linux-native options, dependence on proprietary services

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "I run my own infrastructure" mindset
- Uses Linux on desktop, servers, or both
- Values open source and self-hosting
- Skeptical of cloud-dependent tools
- Wants AI that respects Unix philosophy

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Most AI tools depend on the cloud. They want your data, your subscription, your dependence. You run Linux because you value control. You self-host because you believe in owning your infrastructure. Where's the AI that respects that?

### The Solution
**LinuxClaw: Your self-hosted AI.**

- Native Linux support (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, NixOS)
- Server and desktop deployment
- Self-hosted, air-gapped capable
- CLI-first, scriptable, Unix-philosophy compliant
- Open source, transparent, auditable

### The Hook
> *"AI that respects the penguin."*

## Landing Page Outline

### Hero Section
**Headline:** LinuxClaw — AI That Respects the Penguin

**Subhead:** Self-hosted. Open source. Unix philosophy. Your AI, your infrastructure.

**CTA:** [Get Started] [See Features]

### Problem Section
**Headline:** AI Doesn't Speak Linux

**Body:**
- Most AI tools require cloud, accounts, subscriptions
- Linux-native options are limited or non-existent
- Self-hosting AI is complex or impossible
- CLI-first tools are rare
- You chose Linux for control. AI should respect that.

### Solution Section

- **CLI-First** — Everything scriptable, pipeable, composable
- **Air-Gap Capable** — No internet required after setup
- **Open Source** — Transparent, auditable, community-driven

### How It Works
1. **Install** — Package manager or build from source
2. **Configure** — Your hardware, your models, your rules
3. **Deploy** — Desktop, server, or headless
4. **Integrate** — Scripts, pipes, systemd, cron
5. **Own it** — Your AI, your infrastructure, forever

### Social Proof
