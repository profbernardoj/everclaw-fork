## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
GLM models deliver exceptional Chinese language performance at competitive prices. But tracking model versions, comparing benchmarks, integrating with Chinese platforms, and managing bilingual workflows — that's still manual. Great models deserve seamless tooling.

### The Solution
**GLMClaw: Your GLM operations center.**

- Track GLM model versions and capabilities
- Compare GLM against alternatives for Chinese language tasks
- Manage bilingual prompt workflows
- Integrate with Chinese AI ecosystem
- Run locally — your keys, your data, your control

### The Hook
> *"Chinese AI excellence. Professional tooling."*
