# InstallOpenClaw.xyz — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Generic users discovering AI agents, broad audience, AI-curious but not technical

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-55
- Technical: Low to moderate (wants simple setup, not command lines)
- Values: Easy setup, ownership, privacy, value for money
- Pain points: AI subscription fatigue, privacy concerns, complexity, lock-in

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "I want an AI assistant but don't know where to start" mindset
- Frustrated by subscription costs (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Concerned about privacy and data usage
- Not necessarily technical but wants ownership
- Seeking alternatives to Big Tech AI

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You want an AI assistant. But ChatGPT costs $20/month, reads your conversations, and locks you in. Claude, Gemini, same story. You've heard about "running your own AI" but it sounds complicated. Technical. Not for you.

### The Solution
**InstallOpenClaw.xyz: Your AI, owned.**

- One-click install, no technical knowledge required
- Own your AI forever — no subscriptions, no data harvesting
- Choose your flavor based on your needs
- Community support and guides
- The easiest way to own your AI

### The Hook
> *"Your AI. Your rules. One click."*
