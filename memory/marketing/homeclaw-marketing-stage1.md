## Competitive Landscape

### What Home Assistant Users Currently Use for AI/Voice

| Solution | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **HA Voice Preview Edition** | Native, local, privacy-first | Limited AI capabilities, early stage |
| **Alexa/Google Home** | Mature, widely supported | Privacy concerns, cloud-dependent |
| **Rhasspy** | Open source, local | Complex setup, limited features |
| **Wyoming Satellites** | Local, integrates with HA | DIY, requires technical setup |
| **ChatGPT/Claude Integration** | Powerful AI | Cloud-dependent, no direct HA integration |

### The Gap (HomeClaw Opportunity)
Home Assistant users want:
1. **AI that understands their home** — Knows their devices, rooms, routines
2. **Voice control that respects privacy** — Local processing, no cloud
3. **Contextual intelligence** — "Turn off the lights" means the right lights
4. **Proactive automation** — AI that suggests improvements, detects anomalies
5. **True agent capabilities** — "Order more smart bulbs" — agent figures it out

**This is exactly what HomeClaw provides.**
