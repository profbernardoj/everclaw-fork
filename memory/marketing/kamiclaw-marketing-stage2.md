> Connect KamiClaw and get an AI that:
> - Remembers every document you've ever analyzed
> - Builds a research memory that spans sessions
> - Auto-cites sources from your document corpus
> - Searches across months of Kimi conversations
> - Runs locally — your research, your data

### Taglines

| Tagline | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| "Kimi never forgets. Now neither will your research." | Primary |
| "Your long-context research companion." | Direct |
| "1M tokens. Infinite memory." | Feature |
