## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Most AI tools are built for desktop. You're on Android, maybe using Termux for development, and everything assumes you have a Mac or PC. Mobile AI options are limited or locked down. You want powerful AI on the device you actually use.

### The Solution
**AndroidClaw: Your mobile-first AI.**

- Termux-native AI assistant
- Android shell and system integration
- Mobile-optimized workflows
- Offline capability for on-the-go use
- Runs entirely on your device

### The Hook
> *"Powerful AI. In your pocket."*
