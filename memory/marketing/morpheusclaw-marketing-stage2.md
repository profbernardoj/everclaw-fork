MorpheusClaw is the AI agent built for the Morpheus community — session monitoring, MOR economics tracking, provider intelligence, and node management.

### Value Proposition Statement
> You bought into decentralized AI. You're staking MOR. But tracking sessions, monitoring providers, optimizing stake — it's still manual.
> 
> Connect MorpheusClaw and get an AI that:
> - Monitors every Morpheus session in real-time
> - Tracks MOR staking, rewards, and utilization
> - Compares provider performance across the network
> - Manages node health for operators
> - Built on Morpheus. For Morpheus. By Morpheus believers.

### Taglines
