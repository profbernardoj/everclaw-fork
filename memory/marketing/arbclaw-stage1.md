---

**Demographics:**
- Age: 22-45

- Values: Ethereum security, L2 scalability, DeFi composability
- Pain points: Bridge tracking, cross-chain fragmentation, arbitrage opportunities missed, governance across multiple protocols

**Psychographic Profile:**

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You chose Arbitrum for the low fees. Now you're managing positions across GMX, Uniswap, Radiant, Camelot, and twenty more protocols. Bridge history scattered across explorers. Arbitrage opportunities you missed by 30 seconds. And governance proposals affecting your positions that you didn't see.

### The Solution
**ArbClaw: Your Arbitrum command center.**

- Track every position across the Arbitrum ecosystem
- Bridge history and cross-chain flows at a glance
- Governance monitoring for protocols you care about
- Arbitrage opportunity alerts
- Run locally — your keys, your strategies, your privacy

### The Hook
> *"Arbitrum scales Ethereum. ArbClaw scales you."*
