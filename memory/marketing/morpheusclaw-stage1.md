# MorpheusClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** MOR holders, Morpheus node operators, decentralized AI advocates, "inference you own" believers

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-50
- Technical: High (comfortable with staking, node operation, smart contracts)
- Values: Decentralized AI, open source, community ownership, anti-censorship
- Pain points: Node management complexity, provider selection, MOR economics tracking, session monitoring

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "AI should belong to everyone, not just big tech" mindset
- Active in Morpheus community (Discord, Telegram, governance)
- MOR stakers and node operators
- Values community-owned infrastructure
- Influenced by Morpheus, Trinity, Neo founding narrative

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You bought into decentralized AI. You're staking MOR. Maybe running a node. But keeping track of sessions, monitoring provider performance, optimizing your stake — it's still manual. The infrastructure is decentralized. Your tooling isn't.

### The Solution
**MorpheusClaw: Your decentralized AI operations center.**

- Monitor every Morpheus session in real-time
- Track MOR staking, rewards, and economics
- Compare provider performance and routing
- Manage your node or agent configuration
- Built on Morpheus. For Morpheus. By Morpheus believers.

### The Hook
> *"Inference you own. Tooling you own."*
