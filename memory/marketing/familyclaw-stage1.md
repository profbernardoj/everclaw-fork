## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You're managing a family. School pickups, doctor appointments, birthday parties, meal planning, homework help, activity schedules — and that's before you get to your own job. It's chaos. And the AI tools you've seen are either too technical or too creepy about your kids' data.

### The Solution
**FamilyClaw: Your family's AI assistant.**

- Centralized family calendar and coordination
- Smart reminders for school, activities, appointments
- Parenting help and activity suggestions
- Meal planning and grocery lists
- Runs locally — your family's data stays in your home

### The Hook
> *"Your family deserves an assistant. Not a data collector."*

## Landing Page Outline

### Hero Section
**Headline:** FamilyClaw — Your Family's AI Assistant

**Subhead:** Manage the chaos. Coordinate the schedules. Protect the memories.

**CTA:** [Get Started] [See How It Helps]

### Problem Section
**Headline:** Family Management is a Full-Time Job

**Body:**
- Three kids, four schools, six activities — and only one calendar
- "Wait, when is the birthday party again?" (every week)
- Meal planning falls apart by Wednesday
- School emails get lost in your inbox
- AI assistants sound helpful, but what about your kids' data?

### Solution Section
**Headline:** FamilyClaw: AI That Gets Your Family

**Features:**

- **Privacy First** — Runs locally, your family data stays home

### How It Works
1. **Set up** — Add family members, schools, activities
2. **Connect** — Sync calendars, school portals (optional)
3. **Ask** — "What's the schedule today?" "What's for dinner?" "Activity ideas for a 6-year-old?"
4. **Remember** — FamilyClaw learns your routines and proactively helps
5. **Own it** — Runs on your hardware, your family's data, your control
