# AppleClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Apple ecosystem users, macOS/iOS power users, Apple Notes and Reminders users, iCloud-dependent users

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-55
- Technical: Low to moderate (values Apple simplicity, wants seamless integration)
- Values: Apple ecosystem integration, privacy, seamless sync, native apps
- Pain points: Apple Notes limitations, Reminders gaps, cross-device organization, AI that doesn't "speak Apple"

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "I live in the Apple ecosystem" mindset
- Uses iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch together
- Relies on Apple Notes, Reminders, Calendar, iCloud
- Values native apps and system integration
- Wants AI that works with Apple, not against it

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You live in the Apple ecosystem. Your notes are in Apple Notes, your tasks in Reminders, your events in Calendar, your files in iCloud. But most AI tools don't "speak Apple." They want you to use their apps, their ecosystem, their cloud. You want AI that works with your setup — not against it.

### The Solution
**AppleClaw: Your Apple ecosystem AI.**

- Deep integration with Apple Notes, Reminders, Calendar
- iCloud sync across all your devices
- Native macOS and iOS experience
- Siri shortcuts and automation
- Runs locally — your Apple data stays in your ecosystem

### The Hook
> *"AI that speaks fluent Apple."*
