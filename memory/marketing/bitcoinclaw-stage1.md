# BitcoinClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Bitcoin maximalists, BTC holders, cypherpunks, sound money advocates

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-55
- Technical: Moderate to high (comfortable with self-custody, hardware wallets)
- Values: Decentralization, sovereign individuality, distrust of fiat/centralized systems
- Pain points: Watching AI get captured by Big Tech, wanting AI autonomy without giving up privacy

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "Not your keys, not your coins" mindset extends to AI
- Skeptical of subscription models that extract value
- Values ownership, permanence, and alignment with personal principles
- Active on X, Nostr, Bitcoin Twitter

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
Centralized AI = the new fiat. Big Tech controls the models, the data, the compute. You're renting your intelligence from the same people who deplatformed your friends.

### The Solution
**BitcoinClaw: Your agent. Your keys. Your intelligence.**

- Own your AI agent like you own your Bitcoin
- No subscription, no data harvesting, no deplatforming
- Stake MOR tokens → inference forever (no recurring fees)
- Run on hardware you control
- Align your agent to your values, not a corporation's

### The Hook
> *"You didn't stack sats to rent AI from the same people who told you Bitcoin was a scam."*
