**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-55
- Technical: Low to moderate (wants simple, helpful, no complexity)
- Values: Relationships, connection, thoughtfulness, remembering important dates
- Pain points: Forgetting birthdays, losing touch with friends, awkward "it's been too long" moments

**Psychographic Profile:**

- Busy professionals who value relationships but lack time
- People with friends across time zones and life stages
- Feels guilty about missed birthdays and lost connections
- Values thoughtfulness but struggles with execution

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You have 200+ friends on social media. You talk to 5 of them. Birthdays slip by. "We should catch up soon" becomes "it's been 3 years." You care about these people. But life is busy and memory is unreliable.

### The Solution
**FriendClaw: Your relationship memory.**

- Remember birthdays, anniversaries, important dates
- Gentle reminders to reach out to friends you haven't talked to
- Conversation starters based on their interests and your history
- Track your relationships like you track everything else
- Runs locally — your social life is nobody else's business

### The Hook
> *"Be the friend who remembers. Not the friend who forgets."*
