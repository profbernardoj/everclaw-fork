## Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits
- r/ethereum (2.2M)
- r/defi (500K)

- Create detailed guides and tutorials

### Sample Posts

**r/defi:**
> "How do you track positions across multiple chains?" (Discussion post)
> 
> Context: I've been using spreadsheets but it's getting unwieldy. Curious what tools people use.
> 
> [In comments, mention building EthereumClaw after getting frustrated]

**r/ethereum:**
> "Guide: How to monitor governance proposals that affect your positions"
> 
> [Detailed guide, mention EthereumClaw at the end as a tool that automates this]
