# LlamaClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Open weights advocates, Llama users open source AI community, self-hosters, ML engineers

**Demographics:**
- Age: 22-45
- Technical: High (comfortable with model deployment, GPU infrastructure, Python)
- Values: Open source, transparency, model ownership, no vendor lock-in, community-driven development
- Pain points: Model selection, deployment complexity, fine-tuning workflows, hardware optimization

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "AI should be open" mindset
- Runs Llama locally or on own infrastructure
- Values transparency over convenience
- Active in Hugging Face, GitHub, open source communities
- Skeptical of closed-source AI providers

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You believe in open weights. You run Llama on your own hardware. But managing model versions, comparing benchmarks, optimizing for your GPU setup, and keeping up with the community — that's still work. Open source models shouldn't mean closed-source headaches.

### The Solution
**LlamaClaw: Your open weights operations center.**

- Track every Llama release, variant, and fine-tune
- Compare benchmarks across models and quantization levels
- Optimize for your hardware configuration
- Manage fine-tuning workflows and datasets
- Run locally — your models, your hardware, your control

### The Hook
> *"Open weights. Open tooling. Open future."*

## Landing Page Outline

### Hero Section
**Headline:** LlamaClaw — Your Open Weights Operations Center

**Subhead:** Track, compare, and optimize Llama models. Built for the open source AI community.

**CTA:** [Launch Agent] [See Features]

### Problem Section
**Headline:** Open Source Models, Manual Operations

**Body:**
- 12+ Llama variants and counting
- Benchmark comparisons require manual spreadsheets
- Hardware optimization is trial and error
- Fine-tuning workflows are scattered
- Community updates are easy to miss
- You chose open weights for control. Where's the control?

### Solution Section
**Headline:** LlamaClaw: Open Weights, Organized

**Features:**
- **Model Tracker** — Every Llama release, variant, fine-tune in one place
- **Benchmark Hub** — Compare performance across models, sizes, quantizations
- **Hardware Optimizer** — Recommendations for your GPU setup
- **Fine-Tune Manager** — Datasets, checkpoints, experiments organized
- **Community Feed** — Hugging Face, GitHub, papers — all aggregated

### How It Works
1. **Connect** — Your local Llama setup or cloud infrastructure
2. **Sync** — LlamaClaw indexes your models and hardware
3. **Compare** — Benchmarks, sizes, performance across variants
4. **Optimize** — Hardware-specific recommendations
5. **Own it** — Runs locally, your models, your data, your control

### Social Proof
- "Finally, a dashboard for my Llama experiments" — [ML engineer]
- "Benchmark comparisons used to take hours. Now it's instant." — [Researcher]
- "Found the perfect quantization for my 3090" — [Self-hoster]

### CTA Section
**Headline:** Built for the open source AI community

**CTA:** [Get LlamaClaw]
