> - Connects Grok to your X data for personalized insights
> - Tracks trends and engagement in real-time
> - Generates thread ideas from your X history
> - Analyzes your audience and optimizes content
> - Runs locally — your X data, your privacy

### Taglines

| Tagline | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| "Grok doesn't hold back. Neither should your tooling." | Primary |
| "Your X power user companion." | Direct |
| "Real-time X intelligence. No lectures." | Personality |
| "Built for Grok users. By Grok users." | Community |
| "Unfiltered AI for unfiltered people." | Attitude |
