# WindowsClaw — Stage 1 Marketing Plan

**Created:** February 19, 2026
**Status:** Draft

---

## Target Persona

**Primary:** Windows users, WSL2 developers, Windows power users, enterprise Windows users

**Demographics:**
- Age: 22-50
- Technical: Moderate to high (comfortable with Windows, WSL2, PowerShell, development tools)
- Values: Windows ecosystem, Microsoft integration, enterprise compatibility, flexibility
- Pain points: Linux tool availability, Windows-native AI options, cross-platform workflows

**Psychographic Profile:**
- "I work on Windows, but I want Linux tools" mindset
- Uses WSL2 for development, PowerShell for automation
- May work in enterprise Windows environments
- Values Microsoft ecosystem (Outlook, Teams, OneDrive)
- Wants AI that "speaks Windows"

---

## Core Messaging Wedge

### The Problem
You work on Windows. Maybe you use WSL2 for dev, PowerShell for automation, OneDrive for storage. Most AI tools are built for Mac or Linux. They don't understand your environment, your tools, your workflow. You want AI that works with Windows — not against it.

### The Solution
**WindowsClaw: Your Windows-native AI.**

- Deep integration with Windows, PowerShell, WSL2
- Microsoft ecosystem sync (OneDrive, Outlook, Teams)
- Native Windows terminal and GUI support
- Enterprise-friendly deployment
- Runs locally — your Windows data stays on your machine

### The Hook
> *"AI that speaks fluent Windows."*
