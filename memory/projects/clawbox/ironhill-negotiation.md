## Eric's Follow-Up (2026-02-18)

**Key Points:**
1. **Status check** — Asking about front-end affiliate network progress
2. **ETH Denver opportunity** — Ideal place to announce
3. **Price increase proposal** — $999 → $1,200
4. **Token preload** — $200 of tokens (MOR, etc.) pre-loaded in box-managed wallets
5. **Prototype progress** — Security/OS almost worked out
6. **Pre-order site** — Suggested getting affiliate URLs up even if delayed

**New Unit Economics (Proposed):**

| Item | Original | New Proposal |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Retail Price | $999 | $1,200 |
| Token Preload | $0 | $200 (MOR, Manifest, Venice, etc.) |
| Affiliate Commission | $100 (10%) | TBD |
| IronHill Receives | $900 | $1,000? |

**ETH Denver Context:**
- Dates: Feb 23 - Mar 2, 2026
- Ideal announcement venue
- May cause few days delay

## Eric's Initial Proposal

### Unit Economics

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Retail Price** | $999/unit |
| Affiliate Commission | $100 (10%) |
| **IronHill Receives** | $900/unit |
| Estimated Cost | $500/unit ($400 build + $100 logistics) |
| **Profit per Unit** | $300-400 |

### Profit Distribution (3 Buckets)

| Bucket | Share | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| IronHill Owners | 1/3 | Distributions to owners |
| Affiliate Network | 1/3 | Pro-rated by units sold |
| Operational Reserves | 1/3 | Running business until shutdown/sale |

### Launch Timeline

| Milestone | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Site plumbing tested | This Friday (2026-02-21) |
| Pre-orders start | Same day as site test |
| First boxes ship | End of month (2026-02-28) |

### Scale Projection

- 100,000 units = up to $40m profit for network + affiliates

### Phasing

- **v1:** Test with 1 unit first
- **Scale:** Eventually 3-unit minimum (buying effects)

### Deliverables (IronHill funds these bots)

1. **Setup Bot** — Automates initial configuration
2. **Replication Bot** — Ports user's EverClaw from VM to hardware
3. **Support Bot** — Ongoing user support

## Open Questions for David

### Revenue Position
- David's role in "affiliate network" needs definition
- How does referral from flavor sites → IronHill track?
- Commission structure: Is David part of the 10% up-front, or the 1/3 pro-rated pool?

### Technical Scope
- "Setup bot" = Scott B's DIY guide, or separate?
- "Replication bot" = data migration tool (VM → ClawBox)?
- Who builds these? IronHill funds, but who executes?

### Branding & Control
- "ClawBox" branding — owned by whom?
- EverClaw branding on box — what's included?
- Pre-installed software scope?

### Fulfillment
- Who handles customer support after sale?
- Warranty / returns process?
- International shipping?

## David's Leverage Points

1. **Customer Access** —28 flavor sites as lead generators
2. **Technical Integration** — EverClaw software stack
3. **Community** — Morpheus / BasedAI ecosystem
4. **Data Portability** — Replication bot expertise

---

## Negotiation Priorities

| Priority | Ask | Rationale |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | Clarify affiliate commission structure | Ensure David's referral fees are defined |
| 2 | Define "affiliate network" membership | David should be in the 1/3 pro-rated pool |
| 3 | Control the setup/replication bots | Valuable IP, ensures quality |
| 4 | Brand visibility on product | EverClaw + ClawBox co-branding |
| 5 | Data ownership | User data should stay with user, not IronHill |
