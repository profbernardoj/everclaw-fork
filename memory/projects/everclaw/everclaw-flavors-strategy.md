# EverClaw Flavors Strategy

**Created:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Active Initiative

---

## High-LevelObjective

**Mission:** Create a comprehensive sales funnel for as many people as possible to own their Smart Agent — hardware, data, and inference.

**The Ownership Journey:**
1. **Start:** Use EverClaw on a website in a virtual machine
2. **Port:** Transfer setup and data to hardware they own
3. **Own Forever:** Buy MOR tokens → stake for perpetual inference

**Why This Matters:**
- Individuals own their Smart Agent
- Individuals own their hardware
- Individuals own their data
- Individuals never run out of inference
- Individuals hold the private key
- Individuals align their agent to their values, principles, goals

**The Problem Being Solved:**
Avoid centralized AI players controlling/extracting value from everyone via centralized AI systems — the Web2 advertising model repeated with AI.

## Sales Funnel Architecture

### Stage 1: Sales (Lead by David)
**Entry Points:** InstallOpenClaw.xyz + 28 flavor websites

**User Journey:**
- User discovers flavor-specific site (e.g., BitcoinClaw.ai for BTC holders)
- Marketing materials speak to their specific persona/use case
- Clear path to next stage (VM setup)

### Stage 2: EverClaw Setup (Potential Lead: EthereumDegen/StarkBot)
**Current Candidate:** https://www.starkbot.ai/ → Rebrand to **StarkClaw**

**Function:** Virtual machine setup for instant EverClaw deployment
- User gets a VM with EverClaw pre-configured
- Can start using their agent immediately
- No hardware purchase required yet

**Fallback:** If StarkClaw doesn't work, replace this player

### Stage 3: Inference Access (Lead by Thomas Borrel @ BasedAI)
**Function:** Distributed inference via API Gateway

**Options:**
- Kyle's API Gateway (existing Morpheus)
- BasedAI-maintained API Gateway

**User Journey:**
- User needs inference to power their agent
- Gets access through BasedAI gateway
- Eventually buys MOR to stake their own

### Stage 4: Personal Hardware (Lead by Eric Bravick @ IronHill)
**Branding:** **ClawBox**

**Function:** Hardware sales (Linux boxes, Mac Minis)
- User who started on VM can order hardware
- Their EverClaw setup is copied and shipped
- They own their hardware

**Why This Matters:**
- Apple Mac Minis selling out, Mac Studio expensive
- ClawBox offers alternative under 30 days
- True ownership of the stack

### Stage 5: Hardware Setup (Lead by Scott B.)
**Function:** DIY install Agent guide

**Deliverable:** Step-by-step guide for setting up hardware when it arrives
- Can also be entry point for users with existing hardware
- Users can skip earlier stages if they have hardware

---

## User Entry Points

Users can enter the funnel at different stages:

| Entry Point | Example User |
|-------------|--------------|
| Stage 1 (Sales) | New user discovering AI agents |
| Stage 2 (VM) | User wants to try before buying hardware |
| Stage 5 (DIY) | User already has dedicated hardware |

**Key Insight:** Don't force linear progression — meet users where they are.

---

## Monetization Model

### By Player / Stage

| Stage | Player | Monetization |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Sales | David | Referral fees from VM operator, hardware seller |
| VM Setup | EthereumDegen/StarkClaw | VM rental/hosting fees |
| Inference | Thomas/BasedAI | API Gateway fees (or MOR demand) |
| Hardware | Eric/IronHill | Hardware margin |
| Setup Guide | Scott B | (TBD - could be free, tip-based, or bundled) |

### Indirect Benefit to David
- Owns MOR tokens
- More demand for MOR = token appreciation
- Funnel creates non-speculative utility demand

### Direct Benefit to David
- Referral fees from VM operator when users sign up through flavor sites
- Referral fees from hardware seller (ClawBox) when users purchase
- Each flavor site tracks referrals

---

## Technical Architecture

### Shared Core
- All 28 flavors use the **same EverClaw codebase**
- White-labeled README.md for each flavor (COMPLETE)
- Branding customized at top of funnel

### Community Contribution Model
- Each flavor community can offer PRs to improve their flavor
- Unique skills can develop per flavor
- Underlying core shared across all flavors
- Prevents fragmentation while allowing specialization

## Strategic Notes

1. **Decentralization = Resilience**
   - Each stage has independent operator
   - No single point of failure
   - Incentives aligned across players

2. **Community Ownership**

   - PRs improve each flavor
   - Core remains maintained centrally

3. **Token Economics**
   - MOR staking = perpetual inference
   - No subscription, no limits
   - Non-speculative utility demand

4. **Privacy & Alignment**
   - User holds private key
   - User controls their agent's values
   - No centralized extraction
