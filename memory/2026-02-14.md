## Venice Billing Backoff Config Fix (22:00 CST)

Applied immediate config patch to reduce Venice billing backoff:
```json
{
  "auth": {
    "cooldowns": {
      "billingBackoffHoursByProvider": { "venice": 1 },
      "billingMaxHours": 6,
      "failureWindowHours": 12
    }
  }
}
```
- Venice billing backoff: 5h → 1h (keys retried hourly instead of every 5h)
- Billing max cap: 24h → 6h
- Failure window: 24h → 12h
- Gateway restarted via SIGUSR1 after patch

## Feb 13 Outage Root Cause (from previous session analysis)

### Timeline
- ~4:04 AM: First billing error — overnight research sub-agents (13 tasks from Feb 12) burning DIEM
- ~11:29 AM: Guardian caught stuck sub-agent, restarted. Brief recovery.
- ~4:29 PM: Inference fails again — billing cascade across ALL providers
- 4:33–4:54 PM: Guardian escalates 13 times — zero restart logs. Dead loop.
- ~6:00 PM: DIEM resets at midnight UTC → natural recovery

### Bug 1: Billing backoff death spiral
- 402 on key1 → 5h disable. Keys 2-6 already disabled. Morpheus in cooldown.
- 50 DIEM on key1 not enough for Claude Opus 4.6 (30-50+ DIEM per request with full context)
- Restarting clears cooldown but first request immediately re-triggers 402 → re-disabled
- **Fix applied:** Reduced backoff to 1h via config patch

### Bug 2: Guardian restart chain silently fails
- `set -euo pipefail` causes silent exit when `openclaw gateway restart` returns non-zero
- `pkill -9 -f "openclaw.*gateway"` matches Guardian's own process (self-kill)
- **Fix needed:** Guardian v4 rewrite

### Guardian v4 Plan (NOT YET BUILT)
1. ✅ Config fix — billing backoff reduced (done)
2. Billing-aware escalation — classify errors, don't restart for billing, calculate time to midnight UTC
3. Fix silent restart — `set -uo pipefail` + ERR trap, exclude own PID from pkill
4. Cheaper model fallback — try kimi on same key before disabling profile
5. Proactive credit monitoring — check Venice credits periodically, warn before exhaustion

### Guardian Log Evidence
- 4:29 PM onwards: `WARN: Inference probe failed ... unknown: {` (13 consecutive)
- Each said "Escalating..." but zero "Step 1:" or "RECOVERED" lines
- Circuit breaker fired twice for stuck run `3ef4dda8`
- Recovery at ~6:00 PM when DIEM reset at midnight UTC

## Still TODO
- Build Guardian v4 with billing-aware logic
- Update Everclaw skill docs for v4
- David's pending items from Feb 12 (Morpheus/BasedAI variants, SmartAgent PR #3, etc.)
