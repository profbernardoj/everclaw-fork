## Venice Billing Backoff Config Fix (22:00 CST, from prev session)

Applied immediate config patch to reduce Venice billing backoff:
- Venice billing backoff: 5h → 1h
- Billing max cap: 24h → 6h
- Failure window: 24h → 12h

## Gateway Guardian v4 — Shipped (23:14 CST, from prev session)

Full v4 rewrite of `scripts/gateway-guardian.sh` (502 lines). Silent restart fix, pkill self-kill fix, billing-aware escalation, Signal notifications, billing backoff gate. Committed + pushed to everclaw and SmartAgent.

## Dashboard Unresponsive Issue (00:30-01:15 CST)

David couldn't load OpenClaw Control Panel dashboard on Mac mini.

### Debugging
- Gateway running fine (PID 2890, HTTP 200, WebSocket 101)
- `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` without token loads fine
- With token `#token=...` → redirects to `/chat?session=main` → "Page Unresponsive"
- Chrome on Mac mini gave ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED (gateway bound to loopback only)
- `openclaw webchat` command doesn't exist
- Safari, Chrome, private windows all same result with token

### Root Cause
134 old sessions (17MB total) + current session with 133 messages (480KB, including 91KB tool result from log dump) overwhelmed the browser renderer when the dashboard tried to load chat history.

### Fix
1. Archived 134 old sessions to `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/archive/` (17MB freed)
2. Set up cron job (ID: 3e8ed72f) to auto-archive every 2 days at 4 AM CT using `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`
3. Starting fresh session with /new to clear heavy chat history

### Lesson
Dashboard chokes on large sessions with big tool results. Regular archiving + session resets needed. The base URL without token loads fine — it's specifically the chat history rendering that's the bottleneck.

## Task 1 Research Complete (from prev session)

Peter Steinberger / inference cost response drafted at `drafts/2026-02-13-task1-peter-inference-response.md`. Key findings:
- Peter spending $10-20K/month on OpenClaw, operating at a loss
- OpenAI donates tokens but not sustainable
- Meta and OpenAI both made acquisition offers
- Drafted 3 tweet response options, recommended Option C + DM approach
- Remaining tasks 2-8 still pending (task 4 Coinbase wallets already done from prior session)

## Everclaw v0.9.4 — Smart Session Archiver (01:30 CST)

Shipped `scripts/session-archive.sh` — size-triggered archiver that replaces the "every 2 days" cron approach. Key details:
- **Threshold:** 10MB default (browsers choke at ~15-20MB, DOM rendering is the bottleneck not V8 heap)
- **Protects:** active sessions, guardian probe, 5 most recent
- **Cron:** Updated job to run every 6h instead of every 2 days; no-op when under threshold
- **Tested:** Script correctly measures 4.2MB (excludes archive/ subdir), reports 5.8MB headroom
- Committed + pushed to profbernardoj/everclaw as bb23d9d
- Documented in SKILL.md section 15, updated quick reference

## Morpheus Fallback Fix + v0.9.5 (18:45 CST)

**Root cause found:** Proxy-router (Go binary, port 8082) died Feb 9 (terminated signal, likely MorpheusUI conflict) and had NO launchd auto-restart. The JS proxy (8083) was alive but couldn't open blockchain sessions without the router → infinite retry loop → all Morpheus requests returned 502 → OpenClaw cooldown → agent went dark when Venice DIEM exhausted.

**Fix applied:**
- Restarted proxy-router, verified Kimi K2.5 inference works end-to-end
- Created `mor-launch-headless.sh` — launchd-compatible router launcher with 1Password key injection
- Created `com.morpheus.router.plist` — KeepAlive launchd service (auto-restarts if killed)
- Router now runs under launchd like the proxy and guardian

**Versions shipped tonight:**
- v0.9.5: Router auto-restart via launchd (the missing piece)
- v0.9.6: Provider misconfiguration guard (auto-fix `everclaw/` prefix)
- v0.9.7: diagnose.sh — 18-check health diagnostic (config + infrastructure)

**OpenClaw upgraded:** 2026.2.13 → 2026.2.14 (security hardening, memory fixes, cron fixes)

**Alex's test info (from David):**
- MOR Wallet: `0xBDC1526a7B36CD93dc6D47716a2ad3d0f3696395`
- Morpheus API key: stored (sk-cAMdd6...)

## Overnight Research Tasks — ALL COMPLETE (02:05 CST)

1. ~~Peter's inference video response~~ ✅ Done (prev session) → `drafts/2026-02-13-task1-peter-inference-response.md`
2. ~~Morpheus capital contracts~~ ✅ Done → `drafts/2026-02-14-task2-morpheus-capital-contracts.md`
   - Capital contracts v2 (Sept 2025): multi-asset staking via Aave (stETH, USDC, USDT, wBTC)
   - 320K+ ETH flowed through, 6,500+ capital providers
   - MOR emissions: 24% to capital, 24% code, 24% compute, 24% community, 4% protection
   - No principal risk — only yield diverted to protocol
3. ~~ETH staking yield model~~ ✅ Done → `drafts/2026-02-14-task3-eth-staking-yield.md`
   - Current stETH APY: ~2.5-3.0% (Lido), ~3.3% total with MEV
   - 35.9M ETH staked (28.9% of supply), 1.1M validators
   - At current MOR price ($0.76), yield-for-MOR trade is negative — but early depositors got better terms
   - Net negative staking flows in late 2025/early 2026
4. ~~Coinbase agentic wallets~~ ✅ Done (prev session) → `drafts/2026-02-13-task4-coinbase-wallets.md`
5. ~~Hire agents on Base~~ ✅ Done → `drafts/2026-02-14-task5-hire-agents-on-base.md`
   - x402 Bazaar: 70+ APIs, USDC micropayments, launched Sept 2025
   - Stripe launched x402 on Base Feb 11, 2026 (3 days ago!)
   - Warden ($200M valuation, Venice.AI investor) building ERC-8004 + x402 agent studio
   - Everclaw v0.7 already has x402 client + ERC-8004 reader — ahead of curve
6. ~~Model routing comparison~~ ✅ Done → `drafts/2026-02-14-task6-model-routing-comparison.md`
   - Compared: RouteLLM, Not Diamond, Martian, OpenRouter, IBM, Unify, Pulze, LiteLLM
   - Everclaw router: <1ms, zero dependencies, 3-tier (unique to owned vs premium economics)
   - RouteLLM is more accurate on edge cases but adds 10-50ms + Python dependency
   - Not Diamond best commercial option but SaaS dependency defeats decentralization thesis
   - Key insight: Everclaw's value is routing background work to owned inference, not accuracy
7. ~~SaaS replacement~~ ✅ Done → `drafts/2026-02-14-task7-saas-replacement.md`
   - Bain, Deloitte, Business Insider all published "agents eating SaaS" in past 90 days

   - 7+ providers launched managed OpenClaw in first 2 weeks of Feb 2026
   - Gartner issued rare direct recommendation AGAINST OpenClaw ("insecure by default")
   - All providers offer infrastructure-only — no inference, no security, no skills
   - Based AI opportunity: managed OpenClaw + Morpheus inference + Everclaw security suite
   - Addresses every Gartner concern while providing what competitors lack
