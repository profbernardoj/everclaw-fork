# 💰 Wealth Creation — Strategic Context

## Active Projects
- **Morpheus AI (mor.org):** Open source contributor and GitHub maintainer, owns MOR tokens
- **Based AI:** Strategy role — commercial layer for distributed inference
  - Team: Teana Baker-Taylor, Thomas Borrel, Vanessa Grellet, Michael Casey, Josh Goodbody
  - Serves: Mistral AI, Akash, Venice AI, Morpheus
- **Everclaw:** OpenClaw skill for self-sovereign decentralized inference via Morpheus
- **Johnston's Law:** "Everything That Can Be Decentralized Will Be Decentralized"

## Morpheus Technical Status (Feb 10, 2026)
- **API Billing GA target: March 1, 2026**
- Phasing: Closed beta (OG group) NOW → Open beta (Discord, next week) → Public drip campaign → GA March 1 (free tier turns off)
- **Blockers:**
  - #1: Accounting discrepancies — UI vs backend mismatch on usage/cost, users seeing erratic balances
  - Data leakage — users seeing other users' API keys/usage in UI
  - Coinbase webhook 400 errors (secret config issue)
  - Tokenizer logic — no consensus on source of truth (consumer/provider/gateway token count)
- **Fixed:** ERC-20 allowance bug (sessions resetting MOR allowance), Amplify deployment
- **Infrastructure:** Cognito signups trending up. Liquidity depth issue discovered — fast model switching drains MOR stake faster than expected

## Morpheus Marketing Status (Feb 10, 2026)
- Strategic shift: broad brand awareness → narrow direct response marketing
- Proof-based messaging only — no vague claims (e.g., "perpetual compute") without concrete proof
- Need clear value proposition: "What are we doing and why?"
- Accountability focus: specific deliverables, specific dates, specific target profiles

## Morpheus Sales Pipeline (Feb 10, 2026)
- Target: 10-15 paying clients moving 10-50% of compute traffic to Morpheus
- Qualification: "Do you have money?" + "Are you currently spending it on this solution?"
- Structured interviews: qualifying survey → phone interviews → pain points → refine copy
- Active leads: Agent Swarm (Nate), Panorama Trading (Alex Nascimento) — value prop: decentralized inference avoids audit risks and front-running
- Data siloed across team (Alan: Auth, Kyle: Provider stats, Thomas: Latency/Errors, Swan: UI) — need unified dashboard

## Morpheus Key People
- Alan: Auth/infrastructure
- Kyle: Provider stats, MVM integrations, demand gen
- Thomas B.: API development, latency/errors
- Swan (S): Website/metrics, UI
- Christopher Friedl: Marketing
- Antonb: Marketing/communications
- Scott B: Integration guides
- Brian Bourgerie: Enterprise selling
- Bowen: Content (David proxies for him)
