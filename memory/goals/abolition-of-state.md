# 🏴 Abolition of the State — Strategic Context

## Vision
- Pure free market anarcho-capitalist, voluntarist society
- Develop voluntary free market alternatives to ALL monopoly government services
- Methods: honest, ethical, high integrity — no shortcuts

## Track Record
- Early contributor to Decentralized Applications (dApps) framework adopted by Ethereum
- Developer of the Smart Agents framework
- Created Omni Protocol (originally Mastercoin Protocol) — led to USDT stablecoin
- Coined "Johnston's Law" (2014): "Everything That Can Be Decentralized Will Be Decentralized"
- 100+ conference talks, 100+ articles

## Current Vectors
- Decentralized AI inference (Morpheus/Based AI) — replaces centralized AI gatekeepers
- Onchain property rights (celestial land registry) — replaces state-issued titles
- Smart contracts replacing legal system functions

## Key Thinkers & Frameworks
- **Balaji Srinivasan** (@balajis) — founder of Network School, author of *The Network State*
  - Network State = voluntary smart contract between people with free choice of membership
  - Replaces nation-state model (force-based government monopoly) with opt-in governance
  - His framework for human value in AI age: vision, verification, prompting, polishing, community, geography, scarcity, cryptography, physicality, resiliency

## Actions Taken
- 2026-02-11: Saved Balaji Srinivasan insight on Network State + human value in AI age

## Actions Suggested (avoid repeating)
- 2026-02-12: **Nuclear power / SMR opportunity** — AIER article on free market nuclear approach, $40B DOE loan authority expiring Sept 2026. Suggested: draft "Johnston's Law and the SMR" article; research zero-government nuclear infrastructure (private insurance pools, competing safety certifiers, contractual liability frameworks). This is a Johnston's Law application to the most "government-essential" service.
