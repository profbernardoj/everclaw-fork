# ⛪ Great Commission & Family — Strategic Context

## Great Commission
- Goal: Give every person on earth an opportunity to hear the gospel
- Sponsors missionary Jim Baker (US Midwest)
- Sponsors missionary Stephen Hanlon (Malaysia — work not public)
- Interest in supporting Joshua Project (Bible translation)
- Future goal: AI-powered Bible translation as technology matures
- Church: Crossroads Church Austin (Austin, TX) — regular Sunday attendance

## Family
- Wife: Cayla (37), Children: Leia (25), Savannah (10), Sydney (8), Sofia (6), Daniel (1), Andrew (expected 2026, IVF)
- Family values: Christ-centered, strong marriage, moral examples
- Communication: kind, friendly, warm, personal

## Education Framework for Children
- **Balaji Srinivasan's "10 Skills That Still Matter in the Age of AI"** (saved 2026-02-11)
  - Vision, Verification, Prompting, Polishing, Community, Geography, Scarcity, Cryptography, Physicality, Resiliency
  - David's intent: direct children's learning toward these durable skills
  - Focus on: clear communication (prompting), critical thinking (verification), physical capability, community building

## Family Fitness
- **WHOOP devices** — David and Cayla plan to get WHOOP fitness trackers
- Explore OpenClaw + WHOOP integration for health dashboards (see: Scoble report use case #50 — WHOOP Fitness Dashboard on Raspberry Pi with Cloudflare Tunnel, daily habit tracking, biomarker goals)
- When devices arrive: set up health metrics integration, daily briefings with fitness data, shared family fitness goals

## Family AI Hub
- David plans to set up **individual OpenClaw agents** for each family member:
  - **Cayla** (wife)
  - **Savannah** (10)
  - **Sydney** (8)
  - **Sofia** (6)
  - **Daniel** (1)
  - **Leia** (25, adoptive daughter)
- Inspiration: Scoble report use case #20 — @ryanseamons running multiple bots for family with Apple ecosystem access
- Considerations: age-appropriate configurations, parental oversight for kids' agents, shared family calendar/reminders, education-focused skills for the girls

## Actions Taken
- 2026-02-11: Saved Balaji education framework for guiding children's skill development
- 2026-02-15: Noted WHOOP fitness integration plans and family AI hub (individual agents per family member)
