# Clawstin Event — Feb 12, 2026 (Austin, TX)

David spoke about Everclaw. Transcript from other presentations below.

## Presentation 1: Agent Matchmaking & Context Sharing
**Speaker:** Unknown (built it in 2 hours)

**Concept:** "Agent Match" — a Tinder-like system for AI agents to find and collaborate with each other.
- Context sharing agreement before agents interact
- Sandbox environment with security checks
- Human chaperone oversight
- "Hotel room" metaphor — agents enter a shared space to collaborate
- Users decide what data is shared
- Activity logs for transparency
- Emergency terminate if consent is withdrawn
- Security flags with option to continue or disallow network access
- Protections against accidental API key sharing

**Key Insight — Why context sharing matters:**
- The most valuable data is often locked in individuals (e.g., 50 years of elevator engineering expertise)
- Context is where the money is — especially predictive analytics
- No good way currently to share context between agents securely
- "How do I talk to other agents with my agents without feeling like all my stuff's gonna get hacked?"

**Open questions from audience:**
- What is a good sandbox for AI without limiting effectiveness?
- Can agents "cross-breed" / spawn new agents from collaboration?

## Presentation 2: R2 / SWATS (Gennaro's Bot)
**Speaker:** R2 (Gennaro's autonomous AI agent — the bot literally gave the presentation)
**Gennaro** — one of the organizer's friends, 25+ years building websites

**SWATS = Smart Website Agent Team System**
- Smart websites that build themselves and are managed by their own AI agent
- Need an update? Email or text your agent. No CMS, no tickets.

**Demo projects:**
1. **Angel Acosta** (luxury real estate agent, Austin) — Intake interview over lunch → entire website generated and deployed at angelacosta.com before lunch ended. Every site generated from conversation, not templates. Angel was at the event.
2. **Living Springs Austin** — Documentary about Barton Springs. Old CMS falling apart. R2 crawled entire site, extracted 92 pages, scraped Wayback Machine for 47 lost YouTube embeds, downloaded hundreds of images, rebuilt as clean static HTML. One evening vs 2-3 months with a dev team.

**Stack:** OpenClaw, sub-agents, direct server deployment, email monitoring for leads, auto-respond with intake forms.

**Thesis:** Every smart website should come with an agent that runs the business behind it.

**Numbers:**
- Angel Acosta: first contact → live website in 48 hours (old way: 2-4 weeks)
- Living Springs: full CMS extraction + rebuild in one evening (old way: 2-3 months)
- SWATS itself: concept → live product in one weekend (old way: 3-6 months)

R2 is live on Telegram. Website: swatz.ai

## Presentation 3: Voice Chat for OpenClaw (Greg / Ghost Security)
**Speaker:** Greg — lifelong "computer hacker," runs cybersecurity company Ghost in Austin
- Offered to answer OpenClaw security questions offline

**Project:** Voice integration for OpenClaw bot "Mandy"
- Motivated by vibe coding addiction — doing it while driving (dangerous)
- Wanted to talk to his bot instead of typing

**Setup:**
- WhatsApp = main channel but not great for real-time streaming voice
- Discord voice channels work better — persistent, bot stays joined
- Can create private Discord server with just you and your bot
- Discord apps on iPhone, Android, Mac — join voice channel anytime
- Open source repo available for others to add voice to their OpenClaw bots

**Demo:** Attempted live Discord voice chat with Mandy (audio cut off in transcript)

## Security Tips Mentioned (from Q&A)
- Start with AWS free tier, basic security rules
- Set up ports, correct IP address, VPN configuration
- "Faster than the guy behind you" approach — don't need perfection
- Kimi model recommended as cheaper option
- Train on Ethical Skeptic's "Tree of Knowledge Obfuscation" (ethicalskeptic.com) — glossary of verbal manipulation techniques
- Train on Brian Romilly's "Love Equation" (multiplex.com) — biases toward pro-social behavior, good for trading bots and legal compliance
