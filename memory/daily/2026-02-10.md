## Morpheus Maintainers Meeting Context
David shared full meeting notes. Key takeaways:

### Technical Status
- **API Billing GA target: March 1, 2026**
- Phasing: Closed beta (OG group) NOW → Open beta Discord (next week) → Public drip → GA March 1 (free tier off)
- **#1 Blocker: Accounting discrepancies** — UI vs backend mismatch on usage/cost
- **Data leakage bug** — users seeing other users' API keys in UI (security critical)
- Coinbase webhook 400 errors (secret config)
- Tokenizer source of truth undecided (consumer/provider/gateway count)
- ERC-20 allowance bug FIXED (sessions resetting MOR allowance)
- Liquidity depth issue: fast model switching drains MOR stake faster than expected

### Marketing Shift
- Moving from broad brand awareness → narrow direct response marketing
- Proof-based messaging only — no unproven claims like "perpetual compute"
- Need clear value proposition: "What are we doing and why?"
- Team acknowledged marketing lacks brand association

### Sales Pipeline
- Target: 10-15 paying clients moving 10-50% traffic to Morpheus
- Qualification: "Have money?" + "Currently spending on inference?"
- Active leads: Agent Swarm (Nate), Panorama Trading (Alex Nascimento)
- Value prop for trading: decentralized inference avoids audit risks/front-running
- Data siloed across team — need unified funnel dashboard

### Key People
- Alan: Auth, Kyle: Provider/MVM/demand gen, Thomas B: API/latency, Swan: Website/UI
- Christopher Friedl: Marketing, Antonb: Communications, Scott B: Integration guides
- Brian Bourgerie: Enterprise selling, Bowen: Content (David proxies)

## Revised User Persona Document ✅
Drafted and sent to David based on meeting context:
- **Persona 1: "Cost-Conscious Builder"** — AI startup spending $2K-$50K/month, wants cheaper inference
- **Persona 2: "Sovereignty Seeker"** — Persona 1 graduate who discovers MOR ownership
- Key insight: Lead with cost savings, NOT decentralization. "Open-source models. Enterprise reliability. Pay less."
- Funnel: cheap inference → Gateway trial → MOR discovery → self-sovereign (Everclaw)

## David's Primary Persona Clarification
- Target = people who don't know Morpheus but want cheap inference (99.999% of population)
- Two paths: Gateway (credit card, abstracted) and Everclaw (hold MOR directly)
- Goal: abstract away ALL complexity for users

## Everclaw v0.4 Planning — Zero External Dependencies
Audited all dependencies. Plan to eliminate:
1. **1Password → macOS Keychain** (security command, built-in, no account needed)
2. **Foundry/cast → Node.js with viem** (viem already bundled with OpenClaw)
3. **Safe Wallet → not needed** for single-user setup
4. **jq → Node.js** JSON parsing

Target UX: git clone → one Node command creates wallet + stores in Keychain → send crypto → swap to MOR → start. No external accounts anywhere.

Proposed new script: `everclaw-wallet.mjs` — wallet generation, Keychain storage, balance checks, MOR swaps, all in one Node.js script using viem.

David approved the plan, waiting for go-ahead to build.

## Everclaw GitHub Updates (earlier)
- v0.3.0: Bundled security skills (SkillGuard, ClawdStrike, PromptGuard, Bagman)
- README.md: Install guide, user persona, skill overview
- Language update: "unlimited" → "inference you own" per David's feedback
