## Conversation Summary

assistant: Looking at the script and the symptom (no output at all), this is likely one of two issues. Let me diagnose:
assistant: I see the issue. The script should print a banner and progress messages, but it produced nothing. This usually means the script failed silently early. Here's what the tester should do:

## Diagnosis Steps

**Run with debugging to see where it fails:**

```bash
bash -x /Users/ericclause/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/install-proxy.sh
```

This will show each command as it executes. The `set -euo pipefail` at the top means it exits on first error.

**Common causes:**

1. **Missing template files** - The script copies from `templates/` directory
2. **Missing source scripts** - `morpheus-proxy.mjs`, `gateway-guardian.sh`, `mor-launch-headless.sh`
3. **Permission denied** on `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/` or `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`

**Quick check:**

```bash
# Verify all source files exist
ls -la /Users/ericclause/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/morpheus-proxy.mjs
ls -la /Users/ericclause/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/gateway-guardian.sh
ls -la /Users/ericclause/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/scripts/mor-launch-headless.sh
ls -la /Users/ericclause/.openclaw/workspace/skills/everclaw/templates/
```

**Check if install-prox.sh was actually installed (step 1a):**

```bash
ls -la ~/morpheus/
ls -la ~/morpheus/proxy/
```

If step 1a (the `install.sh` script from everclaw.xyz) worked, they should have a `~/morpheus/` directory with `proxy-router` binary. The `install-proxy.sh` script adds the *additional* components (proxy, guardian, launchd services).

Let me know what the debug output shows - I can provide a more specific fix once we see where it fails.
assistant: Let me check the install-proxy.sh script to understand what's happening:

Thanks. Now back to the marketing planning for HomeClaw. You produced Stage 1 and 2. Lets break the planning for Revenue and Referral Mechanism into Stage 3 and 4 and run only Stage 3 first.
assistant: Let me first recall the previous marketing planning work:
assistant: Now I'll create Stage 3 focused on Revenue & Referral Mechanics:

```json
{
  "message_id": "1771480958514",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

To be more clear. Only develop the revenue stage 3 plan first. Wait to work on the referral mechanism.
assistant: ## Stage 3 Complete — HomeClaw Revenue Model

Saved to `memory/homeclaw-marketing-stage3-revenue.md`

### Key Deliverables

**4 Revenue Streams:**

| Stream | Target | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Hardware (ClawBox) | $10M (10%) | $100/unit affiliate from IronHill |
| Inference Subscriptions | $60M (60%) | Annual pre-paid tiers ($290-$2,990/yr) |
| Enterprise/Support | $20M (20%) | Pro/Business/Enterprise support plans |
| Cross-Flavor Referrals | $10M (10%) | 10% referral credit across 28 flavors |

**$100M Breakdown:**
- 100,000 ClawBox units × $100 affiliate = $10M
- 65,000 annual inference subs at ~$750 avg = $48M (plus MOR staking referral value)
- Enterprise deals + support = $20M
- Cross-flavor referrals = $10M+

**Key Risk:**
The viral multiplier is critical. To hit 100K hardware sales from 200K aware users requires 3-5x referral rate. This is where Stage 4 (Referral Mechanics) becomes crucial.

**Revenue Ramp:**
- Week 1-2: $2.5M (launch momentum)
- Week 7-8: $15-18M (viral acceleration kicks in)
- 60-day total: $75-100M

Ready for Stage 4 (Referral Mechanics) when you want to proceed.

Great save Stage 3 to memory. And then prepare Stage 4.
assistant: Stage 3 is already saved to `memory/homeclaw-marketing-stage3-revenue.md`. Now creating Stage4:

How is stage 4 of referral mechanisms planning going for the HomeClaw?
assistant: Let me check the current state and then complete Stage 4:
assistant: Stage 3 is saved. Now creating Stage 4 — Referral Mechanics:
