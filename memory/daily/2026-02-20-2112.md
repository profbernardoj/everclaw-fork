## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: mor-gateway/glm-5
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Good morning, David! 🧑‍🚀 Fresh session, all systems nominal. What's on the agenda today?

I saw a good example today of how to enhance your files. Please compare the following list to your own and let’s discuss where it makes sense to potentially develop the files we are missing. workspace/ ├── SOUL.md (customized) ├── IDENTITY.md ├── USER.md ├── TOOLS.md ├── BRAIN.md — live working memory ├── MEMORY.md — long-term memory ├── HEARTBEAT.md — autonomous thinking loop ├── CLIENTS.md — client profiles ├── PLAYBOOK.md — decision frameworks ├── VOICE.md — writing voice guide ├── AGENTS.md — startup rules ├── memory/ — daily logs ├── skills/ │ ├── tweet-writer/ │ ├── website-builder/ │ ├── website-dev/ │ ├── script-polish/ │ └── security-auditor/ ├── content/ ├── consulting/ ├── drafts/ └── crm/
assistant: Good comparison exercise. Here's the gap analysis:

**What I have:**
- SOUL.md ✓
- IDENTITY.md ✓
- USER.md ✓
- TOOLS.md ✓
- MEMORY.md ✓
- HEARTBEAT.md ✓
- AGENTS.md ✓
- memory/ ✓

**What's in the example that I don't have:**

| File | Purpose | My Take |
|------|---------|---------|
| **BRAIN.md** | Live working memory | Interesting — distinct from MEMORY.md? Could be scratchpad for active projects |
| **CLIENTS.md** | Client profiles | Could be useful for your consulting/investor relationships |
| **PLAYBOOK.md** | Decision frameworks | Your values are in USER.md, but explicit decision trees could help |
| **VOICE.md** | Writing voice guide | My voice is in SOUL.md, but a dedicated style guide could sharpen output |
| **content/** | Content drafts | I draft things ad-hoc; could centralize |
| **consulting/** | Consulting work | Fits your work style |
| **drafts/** | General drafts | Overlaps with content/? |
| **crm/** | Relationship tracking | Could complement relationships skill |
| **skills/** | Task-specific skills | I have skills, but different ones |

**Questions for you:**

1. **BRAIN.md vs MEMORY.md** — Is BRAIN meant to be ephemeral/active context while MEMORY is curated long-term? Or something else?

2. **CLIENTS.md** — Would this be people you consult for, or broader (investors, collaborators)? 

3. **PLAYBOOK.md** — What kinds of decisions would you want frameworks for? Investment? Messaging? Prioritization?

4. **VOICE.md** — Is this for me to match your voice when writing as you, or for my own consistency?

Which of these feel like they'd actually change how we work day-to-day?

1. Yes, brain is meant to be temporary context while memory is for a long-term storage. 2. I think rather than call it clients.MD we would call it people.MD and it can save information that gets added to the CRM. 3. I think I’d like the playbook.md to include frameworks we develop for Strategy, messaging, marketing, complex code development and such. 4. For voice.MD I want you to match my voice, thinking, and writing style as much as possible when talking to me, but also with any external communications to other people. As for the others, I really like the idea of having a CRM, skills, drafts, consulting, content files too.
