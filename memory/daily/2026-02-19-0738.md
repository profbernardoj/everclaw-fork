## Conversation Summary

assistant: Stage 4 doesn't exist yet. Let me check today's memory and then I'll draft it:
assistant: Creating Stage 4 now:
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):

  "message_id": "1771482716975",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

To clarity only build stage 4 referral mechanisms for the first HomeClaw use case flavor of EverClaw. For example rewarding users with more inference credits or skills for referring a friend via a referral ink. Do not try and build the referrals across all 28 flavors.
assistant: Got it — focused referral mechanics for HomeClaw only. Single-flavor program: refer friends → earn inference credits/skills. Let me buildthat:

A completed cron job is ready for user delivery. Convert the result above into your normal assistant voice and send that user-facing update now. Keep this internal context private (don't mention system/log/stats/session details or announce type), and do not copy the system message verbatim. Reply ONLY: NO_REPLY if this exact result was already delivered to the user in this same turn.
assistant: Got it — Stage 4 focused specifically on HomeClaw's standalone referral program (inference credits, skills, referral links), not the 28-flavor network.

assistant: Heads up: The GitHub discussions you opened for OpenClaw (Morpheus provider, billing-aware errors, session archiver) are still unanswered after ~10 hours. Normal for open source — maintainers may take a day or two. I'll keep monitoring.

Now let me draft Stage 4 — referral mechanisms specifically for HomeClaw:

Now, Stage 4 — HomeClaw's **standalone referral program**. Let me create this:  
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1771485100180",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

Seems we are getting stuck on the referral program step. Let’s put that aside for now and go ahead and run the first 3 stages of the next of the 28 flavors.
assistant: Fair enough — Stage 4 can wait. Let's move to the next flavor.

**Completed:** HomeClaw (Stages 1-3)

**Next choices** (pick one, or I'll recommend based on strategy):

| Flavor | Why It's Strategic |
|--------|-------------------|
| **FamilyClaw** | Natural upsell from HomeClaw (home → family) |
| **InstallOpenClaw** | Entry point for entire funnel |
| **BitcoinClaw** | Large passionate community, clear value prop |
| **EthereumClaw** | DeFi users, high alignment with ownership |
| **MorpheusClaw** | Directly tied to inference layer |

Which flavor should get Stages 1-3 next?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1771485178714",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

Just pick one of the 28 flavors that Random and complete the stage as one by one and then move onto the next save each stage to memory when complete.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1771485759845",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

How’s it going?
assistant: Working on it. Picked **BitcoinClaw** — large passionate community, clear alignment with ownership/self-sovereignty values.
