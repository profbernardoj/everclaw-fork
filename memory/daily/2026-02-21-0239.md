I think we’re still missing one Core File. Let’s add one called Wisdom.MD Knowledge is abundant and you have lots of it in your large language model however, what is uncommon is Wisdom. I want to capture and articulate as much of the wisdom that I’ve amassed over the years as we develop this Wisdom.md file.
assistant: Love this. Knowledge is cheap — wisdom is earned. Let me create it:
assistant: Done. `WISDOM.md` created — empty scaffolding ready to fill.

The structure is simple: sections for the domains where wisdom accumulates. I'll add to it organically as you share insights, lessons, and principles in our conversations. No forced exercises — just capture the real stuff when it surfaces.

What should we add first?

[Signal EverClaw Contributor id:+14432859111 +21m Fri 2026-02-20 16:49 CST] Let’s add to the WISDOM.md file specifically to the business section. Here is an article I wrote summarizing the wisdom I’ve gained from building many startups the last 20 years. “How to Build Unicorn - 33 Laws for Building A Great Company Having been involved early on in multiple projects as a token holder and advocate that have crossed the $1 Billion market cap and 10 traditional startups the last 20 years, after every project I take time to distill the most important lessons I’ve learned from that experience. These lessons have solidified over time as my own personal “Laws of Entrepreneurship”, which I work to periodically refine and remind myself of. Hopefully these “laws of entrepreneurship”, similar to an engineer knowing the “laws of nature”, can help you shape the critical decisions you make, while building your next company, Dapp or project. 33 Laws In Entrepreneurship The over arching and most important law is, ADAPT OR DIE. Start with and always continue focusing on the FUNDAMENTALS — Is your product solving an important problem? Who is the product solving the problem for? How many of these potential customers exist in the world (one hundred, one million, one billion)? How much is solving this problem worth to those customers ($1 / $100 / $10,000 / $1,000,000)? Then test your answers to these questions against the real world and follow the where the data leads. Partner with solid, experienced, passionate, and professional CO-FOUNDERS. There is a very high correlation between having multiple co founders and a higher chance at success in building a company. Startups are a team sport and in order to win you need to find the best team mates with a variety of technical and business skills. Have an ambitious vision for your startup.

There is a very high correlation between having multiple co founders and a higher chance at success in building a company. Startups are a team sport and in order to win you need to find the best team mates with a variety of technical and business skills. Have an ambitious vision for your startup. A compelling vision of the future that really matters to people attracts passionate developers, smart investors, and experienced co-founders. For all that is holy DON’T GO “stealth mode”. If customers, potential co-founders, potential investors do NOT know you exist, then you do NOT exist! Tell EVERYONE about your project, only by leveraging your entire network + the network of your friends, family and co-founders do you even have a chance at assembling all the parts to building a successful startup. Early media coverage, social buzz, and positive press coverage are the life blood of your young startup so don’t be shy about telling people why your startup is awesome. For the most part its really hard to get people’s attention, only by pitching the product to 100 + people will you sharpen the language and develop a good understanding about what people find compelling. Create as many Options for the company as possible, especially the critical path. If you are counting on one investor or customer coming through you are doing it wrong. Always be working to land more investors and customers, many of them will flake out at the last minute or not be the right fit, so always continue feeding the pipeline. This is very much a numbers game, and having 1 option is always the wrong number. Make Real Friendships, Don’t Be a Jerk or Ever Burn Bridges — ALL GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IN BUSINESS IS BUILT ON RELATIONSHIPS. Relationships take time to build, require increasing trust, which comes through regular communication, and consistently doing what you said you would do. Build a team with over-lapping skill sets — Have at least 2 people that can do every critical function. If there is only one person who can access the code, talk with the customers, or knows the investors your startup has a serious single point of failure problem. Co-founders and employees leave all the time, make sure your team knows how to keep moving forward. ALL CO-Founders and employees should VEST their equity — 4 years before full vesting and sticking around 1 year before the first segment vests are smart best practices that protect all the co-founders and investors from the unpredictability of startup life. Spend the time to pick the right partners, investors and early employees — That means always check references, have a 90 trial period, and get to know the person over months not days. Really find out if they are honest, passionate and skilled, not in an interview but consistently day to day. Everything is negotiable. Your startup doesn’t have to take the first term sheet an investor offers or take the first “standard vendor contact” your customer offers. Take your time to make smart decisions, not in the heat of the moment and after consulting your co-founders. No Deal is a “done deal” until the papers are counter signed and the money has changed hands. So Document Everything. Value has not been created until it has be recorded. Every virtual and physical community has entrenched interests, your startup should know who they are and have a plan to address them. Uber had to counter taxi cartels, AirBnB has to figure out complex hotel regulation, even Google back in the day had to address people’s concerns about spiders crawling / reading / indexing their websites. When raising investment for your startup remember that, A. Money follows money, court accredited investors, create deadlines for the round, never count on traditional banks or late stage investors at the early stage, always keep control of the company before the exit, strategic partners will give you a better valuation, revenue is the ultimate way to get cash. While the vision should be world changing, expectations are really important so be realistic about weekly, monthly, annual deliverables and milestones so that you can reach them and show investors / customers you can be counted on to deliver. When trying to go up the learning curve on anything, smart PEOPLE already experts in your space are the best resource for efficient information gathering. Talk to as many of these people as you can, call them on the phone, Skype them, IRC chat them, WeChat or WhatsApps message them, whatever it takes to communicate with them in their preferred channel. Time is more valuable than money for your startup. If you can buy more runway for a little extra money than make that trade every time. Your startup only survives as long as the funding runway to pay the team to keep working on it. Meaning run lean on salaries for co-founders, early revenue will help add to the runway length and court investors 6 to 12 months before you need your next round of funding. Follow the user traction. If that means pivoting your product than do it early and often as you learn what your customers care about and are actually willing to pay for. Follow Up Every Meeting Immediately After. Its exciting to talk with a new customer, advisor, investor, developer, but in order to turn that excitement into something real you need to follow up with an email with a concrete next step. Send along a standard advisor agreement, investor term sheet, request for references, details on how to sign up for you product whatever makes sense. The key is to keep moving toward an objective. Attention is fleeting, send the note right after the meeting and get to the action that mean the meeting worth while. Take introductions and make introductions. If a friend, family member, customer or team member makes an introduction to someone they feel could benefit the startup than take a few meetings to make that connection. Its impossible to know where the connection will lead and if you follow enough levels of introductions you can literally meet anyone no matter how important or powerful. Ask customers, team members and investors to take next steps and pull the trigger. The worst outcome is a friendly, meandering, journey to the land of “no thanks”. Your time is limited and really valuable, keep moving forward with those people that show action toward moving forward. Lots of people will take a meeting just to learn about what you have become an expert in, its the action after the friendly meeting that counts. Publish your accomplishments as widely as possible. This doesn’t mean call the media every time you make a github commit, but remember than name recognition equals the value of your startup. Users can only use a serve they have heard of and general understand what it does. Speak at your industry’s conferences. Speaking at conferences is a short path to credibility, getting attention, meeting your competitors, finding investors and much more. Normally all it costs is an early email or call to a conference organizer when they still need speakers to add to their website before the conference details are published. Find out who the conference organizers are, make friends, help them out by finding sponsors, moderating a panel, volunteering some of your team as staff, whatever it takes. Deals happen in person so get ready to put your startup on a plane. Despite a world awash in virtual communications and constant online chatter, most real business / investment happens in person. There is just something about shaking a person’s hand, looking them in the eye, knowing they are real, friendly, reliable, and building a one on one relationship. So get on a plane to London, Austin, SF, NYC, Shanghai, where pools of talent and money hang out in your industry and be present. Shark Tank isn’t real, its entertainment for those who live outside the startup ecosystem. Investment comes from knowing / having long term relationships with investors. Relationships take time to build so don’t wait until your startup in the making is all polished and ready for launch. Talk with investors early and often and keep them up on your progress. Understand what stage they invest in and the industries and trends that really matter to them. Don’t build an over active Board of Directors who want to micro manage. Strategy, management decisions, and execution have to be driven by full time co-founders and management. No matter how senior / experienced your board members are they normally aren’t focused on your business more than part time and there mostly there for accountability and to change leadership if co-founders / executive leave or need to be replaced. Focus on the core competencies of your startup. If that’s building great software than awesome do more of that. Delegate everything else (the overhead) to people outside your organization. That most likely means running payroll, filing taxes, operating data centers can be someone else focus. You don’t get to be a billion dollar company be spending time on things you aren’t the best at. Your whole startup founding team should know your industry, know your competitors, know the technology trends that drive your business and have a clear strategy. You aren’t a Fortune 100 company yet that can afford to hire “strategy consultants”, its your job to be the expert in this space period. Attack problems your startup has head on. Left go uncommitted people. Make the hard choices they cost less now than if you let them fester and cause other problems. Selling to enterprise customers is great, but remember that the process will take 6 to 12 months from first meeting to signing a contract / delivering a product. So make sure you have the runway to get to the end of that big customer rainbow. Image matters a lot to if you will succeed or fail as a startup. Spend the money and time to have a sharp / modern website, product videos, presentation materials and online presence, this is how most of the world will judge the value of your company in less than 60 seconds. Adapt or Die! You are literally running an experiments to see what works with customers in the real world, if you stop adapting that is running new experiments before you find product market fit / have more revenue than expense you will fail. Therefore pick adaptable team members. </file>
