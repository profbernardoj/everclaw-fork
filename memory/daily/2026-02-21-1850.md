Current time: Saturday, February 21st, 2026 — 4:58 AM (America/Chicago)
assistant: Good morning David — quick status update from the overnight cron jobs:

**Gateway:** Restarted successfully (automated health check passed).

**GitHub Discussions:** The three proposals from Feb 18 (Morpheus provider, billing-aware errors, session archiver) still have no maintainer replies. That's expected for day 3 — open source maintainers often take a week or more to respond. I'll keep monitoring, or GitHub will notify you if there's activity.

Thanks Bernardo. How was the Night Shift?
assistant: The Night Shift skill was created yesterday but the cron job wasn't actually registered — so no overnight tasks ran. That's my oversight.

**What happened overnight:**
- Gateway health check + restart (automated via existing cron)
- GitHub Discussions check (automated via existing cron)
- Morning briefing delivered
- But no Night Shift-specific work

**To fix this:** I need to register the cron job. Want me to set it up so tonight at 9:30 PM it generates an action plan for your approval before 10 PM?

Also — I notice memory files haven't been updated since Feb 19. I should capture yesterday's work (IronHill negotiation follow-up, 28 flavors marketing plans, Docker PR) before it fades. Should I do that now?

Yes do both of those items now.
assistant: I see there's a duplicate Night Shift cron (one from 11h ago, one I just created). Let me clean thatup:
assistant: Done. Both items complete:

**Memory files updated:**
- `2026-02-20.md` — IronHill negotiation, 28 flavors marketing, Docker PR, OpenClaw security verification
- `2026-02-21.md` — Morning status, today's task list

**Night Shift cron registered:**
- Schedule: 9:30 PM CST daily
- Next run: Tonight at 9:30 PM (13 hours from now)
- Job ID: `924b6740-6fb7-4012-9459-95dada12c905`
- Removed duplicate that was created yesterday but not properly configured

Tonight at 9:30 PM you'll get an action plan for approval before the 10 PM - 6 AM window.

assistant: Still quiet on the GitHub discussions — expected for a Saturday. Open source maintainers often take 5-7 days to respond, especially on weekends. The cron is set to check every 4 hours, so I'll let you know when there's movement.

Next design a Morning shift and Afternoon shift (inspired by the structure of the Night Shift. Have the Morning Shift begin at 8 a.m. US central time and send me the list of tasks for approval. With the Afternoon shift send me the list of tasks for approval at 2 p.m. US central time.
