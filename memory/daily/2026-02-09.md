## Morpheus AI Fallback Model Setup ✅

Built and deployed a Morpheus-to-OpenAI proxy so OpenClaw can use Morpheus decentralized inference as a fallback when Venice API credits run out.

### What was done:
1. **Verified proxy-router running** (PID 46592, v5.11.0)
2. **Tested Kimi K2.5 via Morpheus** — works reliably; `kimi-k2.5:web` variant tends to timeout, `kimi-k2.5` (non-web) is solid
3. **Built `morpheus-proxy.mjs`** (`~/morpheus/proxy/`) — Node.js proxy that:
   - Accepts standard OpenAI API format
   - Auto-manages blockchain sessions (opens on demand, 2h duration, renews before expiry)
   - Injects Basic auth + `session_id`/`model_id` headers to Morpheus router
   - Exposes `/health`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`
4. **Set up launchd** (`com.morpheus.proxy`) — auto-starts, KeepAlive, port 8083
5. **Configured OpenClaw** — added `morpheus` provider + set `morpheus/kimi-k2.5` as fallback model
6. **Updated auth-profiles.json** with morpheus:default credentials
7. **Updated TOOLS.md** with proxy documentation

### Key details:
- Proxy port: 8083 (localhost)
- Fallback chain: `venice/claude-opus-4-6` → `morpheus/kimi-k2.5`
- MOR tokens staked per session (~11.4 MOR for 1h, ~22.8 for 2h) — returned when session closes
- Single provider for all Morpheus models: `0x8B59eC5Da5E5CE83abB3BD9079472f7B25666302` (provider.mor.org:3333)

### OpenClaw Updated to v2026.2.9
- Updated from v2026.2.6-3 → v2026.2.9 via `update.run`
- 668 packages changed, clean restart

### Morpheus Models Added to Dashboard
- Added aliases in `agents.defaults.models` so Morpheus models appear in the dashboard dropdown:
  - `morpheus/kimi-k2.5` → "Kimi K2.5 (Morpheus)"
  - `morpheus/kimi-k2-thinking` → "Kimi K2 Thinking (Morpheus)"
  - `morpheus/glm-4.7-flash` → "GLM 4.7 Flash (Morpheus)"
- Added `morpheus:default` auth profile in config

### Security Audit — All Clear ✅
- Ran SkillGuard batch scan on all 52 bundled skills + 5 workspace skills
- No malicious ClawHavoc skills found — all flagged items were false positives
- False positives from: security reference docs (bagman, prompt-guard, skillguard), and legitimate API-calling skills (local-places, openai-image-gen, openai-whisper-api)
- No third-party ClawHub-installed skills present

### Morpheus Fallback Live Test ✅
- Switched model to `morpheus/kimi-k2.5` at ~2:11 PM CST
- ~5.5 hour gap before next response (possible cooldown issue during initial switch)
- Successfully responded at ~7:57 PM CST running on Morpheus/Kimi K2.5
- Proxy auto-renewed expired sessions correctly
- **Confirmed: agent can run entirely on Morpheus decentralized inference as fallback**

### Venice API Credits
- David mentioned only a little credit left for the next ~4 hours (as of 2:00 PM CST)
- Credits should refill around 6:00 PM CST based on that estimate

### Gateway Guardian Deployed ✅
- Script at `~/.openclaw/workspace/scripts/gateway-guardian.sh`
- Runs every 2 minutes via launchd (`ai.openclaw.guardian`)
- Strategy: HTTP probe → 2 consecutive failures → restart
- Restart chain: `openclaw gateway restart` → hard kill (launchd KeepAlive restarts) → `launchctl kickstart`
- Logs: `~/.openclaw/logs/guardian.log`
- State tracking: `~/.openclaw/logs/guardian.state`
- Already caught a real issue earlier today (12:44 PM — HTTP 200 but RPC failing, successfully restarted)
- Crontab approach didn't work (hangs, likely needs Full Disk Access), used launchd instead

### Morpheus 7-Day Sessions ✅
- Updated proxy to use 604800s (7-day) sessions instead of 2h
- Auto-renews 1 hour before expiry
- Tested and confirmed working — session expires Feb 17

### Everclaw v0.3.0 — Security Skills Bundled ✅
- Added 4 security skills under `security/` directory: SkillGuard, ClawdStrike, PromptGuard, Bagman
- Updated SKILL.md with Section 14 covering all security skills
- Pushed and tagged v0.3.0

### Everclaw README.md ✅
- Created comprehensive README with install command, user profile, skill overview
- Target user: early adopter non-engineer running always-on OpenClaw agents
- All 6 components listed with benefits table

### Weekly Life Goals Cron Jobs ✅
Set up 7 strategic advisor cron jobs aligned to David's life goals:
- Mon 6AM: 🚀 Space Settlement (lunar registry, SpaceX)
- Tue 6AM: 💰 Wealth Creation (Morpheus, Based AI, MOR)
- Wed 6AM: ⛪ Great Commission & Family (missionaries, translation, family)
- Thu 6AM: 🏴 Abolition of the State (decentralized alternatives)
- Fri 6AM: 🔄 Weekly Synthesis (cross-goal synergies, scorecard)
- Sat 7AM: 🎉 Weekend Fun Planner (Austin events, kids activities)
- Sun 8PM: 🙏 Week Ahead Preview (weather, calendar, priorities)

Each reads/updates its own context file in `memory/goals/` to avoid repeating suggestions and build on prior weeks. Created initial context files for all 5 goal areas.

### Still TODO:
- Memory search is broken (no OpenAI/Google/Voyage API keys for embedding)
- Investigate the ~5.5h gap when switching to Morpheus — may need to handle OpenClaw cooldown behavior for new providers more gracefully
- ClawHub publish reminder set for Feb 16 (GitHub account 7 days old)
