user: [Fri 2026-02-13 16:41 CST] Bernardo, I got this message. 12:00 PM ⚠️ Agent failed before reply: All models failed (4): venice/claude-opus-4-6: 402 "Insufficient USD or Diem balance to complete request" (unknown) | venice/claude-opus-45: No available auth profile for venice (all in cooldown or unavailable). (rate_limit) | venice/kimi-k2-5: No available auth profile for venice (all in cooldown or unavailable). (rate_limit) | morpheus/kimi-k2.5: Provider morpheus is in cooldown (all profiles unavailable) (rate_limit). Logs: openclaw logs --follow However its confusing because I see there is still 50 Diem of credits available on the 1st key in your rotation.
