## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: mor-gateway/glm-5
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey David — fresh session on GLM-5, ready to go. What's on deck today?

To send an image back, prefer the message tool (media/path/filePath). If you must inline, use MEDIA:https://example.com/image.jpg (spaces ok, quote if needed) or a safe relative path like MEDIA:./image.jpg. Avoid absolute paths (MEDIA:/...) and ~ paths — they are blocked for security. Keep caption in the text body.

[Signal EverClaw Contributor id:+14432859111 +4m Fri 2026-02-20 15:17 CST] I’d like to add some new files. Here’s the context in 3 parts. 1. My first statement: “I saw a good example today of how to enhance your files. Please compare the following list to your own and let’s discuss where it makes sense to potentially develop the files we are missing. workspace/ ├── SOUL.md (customized) ├── IDENTITY.md ├── USER.md ├── TOOLS.md ├── BRAIN.md — live working memory ├── MEMORY.md — long-term memory ├── HEARTBEAT.md — autonomous thinking loop ├── CLIENTS.md — client profiles ├── PLAYBOOK.md — decision frameworks ├── VOICE.md — writing voice guide ├── AGENTS.md — startup rules ├── memory/ — daily logs ├── skills/ │ ├── tweet-writer/ │ ├── website-builder/ │ ├── website-dev/ │ ├── script-polish/ │ └── security-auditor/ ├── content/ ├── consulting/ ├── drafts/ └── crm/ “ 2.

BRAIN.md vs MEMORY.md — Is BRAIN meant to be ephemeral/active context while MEMORY is curated long-term? Or something else? 2. CLIENTS.md — Would this be people you consult for, or broader (investors, collaborators)? 3. PLAYBOOK.md — What kinds of decisions would you want frameworks for? Investment? Messaging? Prioritization? 4. VOICE.md — Is this for me to match your voice when writing as you, or for my own consistency? Which of these feel like they'd actually change how we work day-to-day?” 3. Here was my reply. “1. Yes, brain is meant to be temporary context while memory is for a long-term storage. 2. I think rather than call it clients.MD we would call it people.MD and it can save information that gets added to the CRM. 3. I think I’d like the playbook.md to include frameworks we develop for Strategy, messaging, marketing, complex code development and such. 4. For voice.MD I want you to match my voice, thinking, and writing style as much as possible when talking to me, but also with any external communications to other people. As for the others, I really like the idea of having a CRM, skills, drafts, consulting, content files too.” </file>

Back online?
assistant: Yep, back online. Let's build these out.
assistant: Done. New structure:

**Core Files:**
- **BRAIN.md** — Live working memory (ephemeral, scratchpad for active projects)
- **PEOPLE.md** — Profiles from your network (syncs to CRM)
- **PLAYBOOK.md** — Decision frameworks for strategy, messaging, marketing, code
- **VOICE.md** — Your writing style guide (for me to match your voice)

**Directories:**
- **crm/** — Contact tracking, interactions, follow-ups
- **content/** — Twitter, blog, video, podcast drafts
- **consulting/** — Client projects, proposals, deliverables
- **drafts/** — General-purpose scratch drafts

PEOPLE.md is pre-populated with everyone from USER.md + others we've interacted with. PLAYBOOK has frameworks for tech adoption, investment decisions, messaging, code deployment, prioritization — all drawn from how you actually work.

VOICE.md is the key one for me — it captures your direct-but-kind tone, vocabulary preferences, thought patterns, and "sounds like David" vs "doesn't sound like David" markers. I'll use this whenever I write as you or for you.

Want me to add anything else or adjust any of these?

  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

That all sounds really good
assistant: Good. The structure is solid now — brain for active work, people for relationships, playbook for decisions, voice for style. Plus the working directories for content, consulting, drafts, and CRM.

What's next?

I think we’re still missing one file. Let’s add one called Wisdom.MD Knowledge is abundant and you have lots of it in your large language model however, what is uncommon is Wisdom. I want to capture and articulate as much of the wisdom that I’ve amassed over the years as we develop this file.
