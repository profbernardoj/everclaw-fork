## Conversation Summary

user: Hey this is David. I accidentally exited the on boarding before the shell completion script was run. Can you run it?
[message_id: 695e7fc5-5656-449c-8287-31db7934aa4d]
assistant: Hey David! No worries — let's get that shell completion set up for you.

What shell are you using? (bash, zsh, or fish?)

Once you tell me, I'll run the right setup command for you. Or if you want, I can just set it up for zsh (most common on macOS) — let me know!
user: I'm running zsh
[message_id: 2f6e7bf1-478a-4442-9880-884982c47452]
assistant:  Done! The zsh completion script has been installed to your shell profile.

To start using it right away, either:
- **Reload your shell**: `exec zsh`
- **Or source it directly**: `source ~/.zshrc`

Then you can use tab completion with `openclaw` commands — try typing `openclaw ` and hitting tab to see the available commands!
user: Just ran this in the terminal but got this message. bernardo@Mac ~ % openclaw tui zsh: command not found: openclaw

user: Let's get Signal set up.
[message_id: 197725f4-8525-4bfe-adbc-f5236d18c7f0]
assistant: Cool, let's get Signal set up. There are a few steps:

1. **Install signal-cli** (requires Java)
2. **Link a Signal number** for the bot (you'll scan a QR code)
3. **Configure OpenClaw** with the Signal account

**First, do you have Java installed?** Let's check:
assistant: You'll need Java first. Let me install it via Homebrew:
user: Wake up, my friend!

assistant: Hey! I'm awake — was waiting on that Java install to finish. Let me check the status:
