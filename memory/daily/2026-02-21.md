### EverClaw v2026.2.21 Release — Complete Rollout
- **Pushed v2026.2.21 to all 30 repos** (everclaw + 28 flavors + baseclaw.ai)
  - Three-shifts skill added
  - Gateway Guardian v5 (direct curl probes)
  - Version scheme: semver → date-based
  - Batch script: clone → sed/perl edits → commit → push (5 repos at a time, 6 batches)
- **PR #9 to EverClaw/everclaw org repo** — merged by David
- **Added release process reminder to MEMORY.md**: always PR to org repo on named versions

### EverClaw Community Branches — Code Reviews + PRs
David added placeholder files (IronClaw, NanoClaw, Nanobot, TinyClaw, PicoClaw, NullClaw, ZeroClaw) to EverClaw/everclaw org repo. I reviewed all 7, found issues, fixed them:

| PR | Branch | Key Issues Fixed |
|---|---|---|
| #2 | IronClaw | WASM: reqwest::blocking impossible in WASM → rewrote with wasi:http, added WIT world, Rig examples |
| #3 | NanoClaw | IronClaw refs leaked in, missing Claude skill/setup.sh, added Docker host networking |
| #4 | Nanobot | No actual code — added setup.sh, YAML configs, MCP server interface, shell alias |
| #5 | TinyClaw | No actual code — added setup.sh with safe JSON merge, settings.patch, dev-team example |
| #6 | PicoClaw | No actual code — added memory-aware setup.sh, PROXY_HOST for split deployment |
| #7 | NullClaw | No actual code — added Zig TCP status tool, systemd service, Nix flake overlay |
| #8 | ZeroClaw | No actual code — TOML config, Rust/ureq status tool, OpenRC service |

All 7 PRs merged by David.

- **PR #10** — Synced all 7 community READMEs with v2026.2.21 features section — merged
- **PR #11** — Docker update: fixed broken Dockerfile (CMD pointed to nonexistent index.js), added docker-compose.yml, .dockerignore, multi-arch builds — pending merge

### Gateway Device Token Fix
- **Root cause**: CLI device (`06d3714f...`) missing `operator.write` scope (required by newer OpenClaw)
- Gateway auto-created a repair pairing request — I approved it
- Dashboard browser still had stale token → David opened in Safari (works)
- Cleaned up 2 never-used dashboard device entries (96c419ae, a97e14a8)
- Down from 7 to 5 paired devices

### OpenClaw v2026.2.21 Security Audit
- **License**: MIT unchanged ✅
- **No OpenAI deps**: zero `openai` npm packages ✅
- **No OpenAI defaults**: model aliases same pattern (one of many providers) ✅
- **Notable**: fixes our exact device token mismatch issue, cron maxConcurrentRuns fix, heartbeat fix
- **Recommendation**: safe to update to 2026.2.21-2 (David said not yet)

### Model Switch
- Switched session to venice/claude-opus-4-6 (mor-gateway/glm-5 was timing out for cron jobs)
