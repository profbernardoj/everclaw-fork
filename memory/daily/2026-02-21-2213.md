## Conversation Summary

assistant: The page didn't render the actual releases content. Let me use the API:
assistant: Big release. Now let me run the security checks:
assistant: Here's the audit report:

## OpenClaw v2026.2.21 Security Audit ✅

### License
**MIT — unchanged.** Still "Copyright (c) 2025 Peter Steinberger". No license changes.

### OpenAI Dependencies
**None.** No `openai` npm package in any dependencies. Zero new OpenAI-specific packages added.

### OpenAI References in Code
**Same as before** — OpenAI appears only as:
- One of many provider options for embeddings (`openai`, `gemini`, `voyage`, `local`)
- Model aliases (`gpt` → `openai/gpt-5.2`, `gpt-mini` → `openai/gpt-5-mini`) — these are standard catalog entries, not defaults
- Provider usage tracking/cost calculation (same treatment as all providers)

No OpenAI API keys, endpoints, or special treatment injected.

### Default Models
**No change to defaults.** Model aliases are the same pattern — `opus` → Anthropic, `gpt` → OpenAI, `gemini` → Google. Your config overrides these entirely.

### EverClaw Compatibility
**No conflicts.** Specifically:
- Skill loading (`SKILL.md`) — unchanged mechanism
- Gateway pairing — **improved**: the `device token mismatch` / `operator.write` scope issue we just fixed is actually addressed in this release (they added `scope-upgrade` handling and repair flows)
- `mor-gateway` / Morpheus — no references, no interference
- Custom providers — unchanged

### Notable for Us
1. **Gateway pairing fix** — v2026.2.21 includes fixes for the exact `device token mismatch` / `scope-upgrade` issue we hit today. The new release handles legacy devices missing `roles`/`scopes` and has better repair flows.
2. **Cron fix** — `cron.maxConcurrentRuns` now works properly (was always serial before)
3. **Heartbeat fix** — missing `HEARTBEAT.md` no longer suppresses runs
4. **Subagent depth** — default `maxSpawnDepth=2` now
5. **Lots of security fixes** — exec allowlist hardening, browser sandbox improvements, heredoc injection blocking
6. **Latest npm is `2026.2.21-2`** — the release notes mention a follow-up fix

### Recommendation
**Safe to update.** No OpenAI integration, license unchanged, and it actually fixes the pairing issue we manually repaired. Update to `2026.2.21-2` (latest patch):

```bash
npm update -g openclaw
openclaw gateway restart
```

Great. No update just yet. First, I could use your help updating the Docker for EverClaw to match the latest code on the Github.com/EverClaw/Claw repo. Thanks.
assistant: Let me check what's in the repo now and what the Docker setup looks like.
assistant: Now I have a clear picture. The Dockerfile has several issues:

1. **Version hardcoded** to `0.9.8.3` as default ARG — should be `2026.2.21`
2. **`CMD ["node", "index.js"]`** — there's no `index.js`. The main entry point is `scripts/morpheus-proxy.mjs`
3. **Health check** is trivial (`node -e "console.log('healthy')"`) — should actually probe the proxy
4. **Missing proxy port exposure** — port 8083 not exposed
5. **No `.dockerignore`** — copies everything including `.git`, docs, community dirs
6. **No systemd/launchd alternative** — container should use the proxy directly
7. **GitHub Actions workflow** uses `semver` tag pattern — needs updating for date-based versioning
8. **`npm ci --only=production`** — deprecated flag, should be `--omit=dev`
assistant: Now update the GitHub Actions workflow for date-based versioning:
assistant: Now update the build-and-push script:
assistant: Now add a `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment:
assistant: Now let me verify everything and commit:
assistant: [PR #11](https://github.com/EverClaw/everclaw/pull/11) is ready. Here's what was wrong and what's fixed:

**Critical fixes:**
- **CMD pointed to `index.js` which doesn't exist** → now runs `scripts/morpheus-proxy.mjs`
- **Health check was fake** (just printed "healthy") → now actually curls the proxy
- **Port 8083 wasn't exposed**
- **Version was still `0.9.8.3`**

**New additions:**
- `docker-compose.yml` — `docker compose up -d` and you're running
- `.dockerignore` — keeps the image lean (no .git, docs, community dirs)
- Multi-arch builds — both `amd64` and `arm64` (important for ClawBox if those are ARM)
- Configurable env vars for port, host, and auth token

Thanks. Go ahead and update to the latest version of OpenClaw.
assistant: Now post-update checks:
