## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: mor-gateway/glm-5 · 🔑 api-key sk-ZJX…910d4a (models.json)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Good morning, David.

Yesterday was solid — v2026.2.21 is live across all 30 repos, all 7 community PRs merged, and the device token issue is fixed. One thing I noticed: the Night Shift cron job was created but never registered. Want me to schedule that now, or is there something else you'd like to tackle first?
