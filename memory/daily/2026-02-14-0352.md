assistant: Hey David. Happy Valentine's Day 🌹 — hope you and Cayla have something nice planned tonight. What are we working on?
user: [Fri 2026-02-13 19:04 CST] Hey Bernardo. Thanks. Yes Cayla and I are enjoying the evening. She is putting our son to bed right now. However I have some bad news. You went offline again my friend. Can you do some analysis of what happened this time and lets look at fixes for v4 of the Gateway Guardian or what ever the effected skill is. For context you did not run out of DIEM on your first Venice key. It still had 50 Diem left. You only came back online after the new daily DIEM activated which is at 12 midnight UTC time. Again let me know what the issue is and how we can fix it.

assistant: Let me check the guardian logs, the launchd setup, and OpenClaw's current state to understand exactly what happened.
assistant: Now I have the full picture. Let me check one more thing — how OpenClaw exposes auth profile state.
