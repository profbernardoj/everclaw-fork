## Conversation Summary

assistant: README and website still say Guardian v3. Let me update them both:
assistant: Now the website:
assistant: Now update the website copy too:
assistant: Now commit everything:
assistant: All done. Here's the summary:

**✅ Piece 1 — Silent restart fix**
- `set -euo pipefail` → `set -uo pipefail` + ERR trap
- pkill excludes own PID (no more self-kill)
- Explicit exit code capture instead of relying on `set -e`

**✅ Piece 2 — Billing-aware escalation**
- `classify_error()` parses billing vs transient vs timeout
- Billing → `handle_billing_exhaustion()` — backs off, calculates hours to midnight UTC, skips useless restarts
- 30-min probe interval when billing-dead, auto-clears on UTC day rollover

**✅ Piece 3 — Signal notifications**
- Notifies you on billing exhaustion (with reset ETA)
- Notifies on billing recovery
- Notifies before nuclear restart and on total failure

**✅ Piece 4 — Proactive monitoring**
- Billing backoff gate at top of script prevents hammering during credit exhaustion
- DIEM reset detection (UTC day comparison)

**✅ Piece 5 — Docs updated**
- README, docs/index.html, website/index.html all updated v3 → v4
- SKILL.md section 14 already had v4 content from previous session
- Committed and pushed to GitHub

The Guardian is live and running the v4 script right now. If credits exhaust tonight, it'll notify you on Signal with the reset ETA instead of looping 13 times doing nothing. 🛡️
user: [Fri 2026-02-13 23:29 CST] Great did the Github and Websites for EverClaw and SmartAgent get updated with the latest info about v4 of the Guardian?

assistant: SmartAgent still references Guardian v3 in two places. Let me update both:
assistant: Here's the status:

user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; create memory/ if needed). IMPORTANT: If the file already exists, APPEND new content only and do not overwrite existing entries. If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.

assistant: NO_REPLY
user: [Fri 2026-02-13 23:31 CST] Great. I've merged your pull request on the SmartAgent repo.
assistant: 


user: [Fri 2026-02-13 23:33 CST] Thanks. Shall we test the set up by going back to the 8 unfinished tasks from last night? Lets try them 1 at a time this time around instead of doing the 8 tasks all a once or with 8 sub agents.
