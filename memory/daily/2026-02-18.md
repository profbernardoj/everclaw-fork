# 2026-02-18

## Session Context
- Date: Tuesday, February 18, 2026
- Model: mor-gateway/glm-5

## Status Checks
- HEARTBEAT.md: Empty (no configured heartbeat tasks)
- Gateway: ✅ FIXED - was showing "device token mismatch" error
- Morpheus session: Expires ~2026-02-18 (today) - may need renewal

## Gateway Token Fix (2026-02-18)
**Issue**: Gateway showing "device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)" error
**Root cause**: device-auth.json had empty tokens, and paired.json had outdated token
**Fix applied**:
1. Rotated device token: `openclaw devices rotate --device <device-id> --role operator --url "ws://127.0.0.1:18789" --token <old-token>`
2. Synced device-auth.json with paired.json token
3. Updated openclaw.json gateway.auth.token with new token
4. Reinstalled gateway LaunchAgent: `openclaw gateway install --force`
**New operator token**: `_ILEwoSWopzKcxREt3-7wGORXDfLS_wNHmWrirvClVc`
**Key files synced**:
- ~/.openclaw/identity/device-auth.json (CLI device auth)
- ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json gateway.auth.token (gateway auth)
- ~/.openclaw/devices/paired.json (device registry)
**Lesson**: When device-auth.json tokens are empty or mismatched, the CLI can't authenticate with the gateway even if the gateway is running. Always sync these three files after token rotation.
