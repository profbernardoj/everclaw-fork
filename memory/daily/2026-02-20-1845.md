Hey Bernardo. Back online?
assistant: Yeah, back online and running on GLM-5 via Morpheus. Ready to roll — what do you need?

I'd like you to find or develop a CRM skill so we can develop richer context about all the people I know or work with. Categorize into family, close friends, church friends, colleagues, broader community, strangers, bad actors, and unknown.
assistant: Let me check ClawHub for existing CRM skills, then we'll build what youneed.
assistant: Rate limited on ClawHub. Let me build you a custom CRM skill tailored to your categories — it'll integrate with your existing memory system.

How is it going. We may need to break this into planning and development steps.
assistant: Going well. Here's where we are:

**Done:**
- Created `relationships` skill with 8 categories
- Set up directory structure under `memory/relationships/`
- Seeded all 7 family members from USER.md

**What's left:**

| Phase | Tasks |
|-------|-------|
| **1. Populate** | Add contacts from your existing network (Morpheus team, Based AI, missionaries, space contacts, etc.) |
| **2. Develop** | Build interaction logging, search commands, maybe a summary view |
| **3. Integrate** | Hook into daily notes, heartbeat checks, memory consolidation |

**Next question:** Want me to start populating from what I know (Morpheus team: Alan, Kyle, Thomas B, Swan, Christopher, Antonb, Scott B, Brian, Bowen — plus Based AI team, missionaries, space contacts)? Or would you prefer to develop the tooling first?
user: [Fri 2026-02-20 12:03 CST] [System Message] [sessionId: 62e70db5-b6bf-4f93-9363-0c878a0530f6] A cron job "Smart session archiver" just completed successfully.

Result:
Smart session archiver complete. 

Checked 31 sessions (30.0MB total). The system is well above the 10MB threshold, so it archived the oldest 4 inactive sessions — freeing up ~0.08MB. 

**Before:** 30.0 MB (31 sessions)  
**After:** 30.0 MB (39 active sessions)  
**Archived:** 4 sessions (84KB total)

Dashboard is healthy. Current session count is 39 after the cleanup.

Stats: runtime 43s • tokens 0 (in 0 / out 0)

A completed cron job is ready for user delivery. Convert the result above into your normal assistant voice and send that user-facing update now. Keep this internal context private (don't mention system/log/stats/session details or announce type), and do not copy the system message verbatim. Reply ONLY: NO_REPLY if this exact result was already delivered to the user in this same turn.
assistant: Session archiver just ran — cleaned up 4 old sessions. Dashboard's healthy.

Yes go ahead and develop the tooling first. 1. Yes, interaction logging, search commands, and a summary view in the Dashboard would be great. 2. Yes hooks would be good. Then: 3. Yes. Go ahead and populate the contacts from my existing network.
assistant: Building it out. Let me spawn a sub-agent for the development work — this'll be faster for tooling + contactpopulation.
assistant: No sub-agents allowed in this session. Building it directly — this'll take a fewminutes.

I'm seeing this error in your Gateway Dashboard. "disconnected (1008): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)"
