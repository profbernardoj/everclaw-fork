I didn't see Home Claw can you make the prompt for that one.
assistant: Here's the HomeClaw prompt:

---

**Prompt for Lovable:**

```
Create a landing page for HomeClaw (homeclaw.org) — an AI assistant that manages your smart home and integrates with Home Assistant.

## HERO SECTION

**Headline:** AI for Your Smart Home.

**Subheadline:** HomeClaw connects to your smart home, automates routines, and helps you control your living environment with natural language.

**Primary CTA:** [Get HomeClaw →] (links to GitHub or signup)

**Secondary CTA:** [See How It Works ↓]**

**Visual:** Show smart home dashboard, device controls, or automation interface

## PAIN POINT SECTION

**Headline:** Smart Homes Are Dumb

3-4 pain point cards:

📱 **App Overload**
"Lights, thermostat, locks, cameras — each has its own app. No unified control."

🤖 **Automation Frustration**
"I want it to just work. But writing automations is hard."

🗣️ **Voice Assistants Fail**
"I ask for something. It misunderstands. I give up and use the app."

🏠 **No Real Intelligence**
"Smart home should anticipate. Instead, I'm still controlling everything manually."

## SOLUTION SECTION

**Headline:** HomeClaw Makes Your Home Actually Smart

**What it does:**
- ✅ Integrates with Home Assistant and smart devices
- ✅ Natural language control — "Turn off all the lights downstairs"
- ✅ Learns your routines and suggests automations
- ✅ Monitors your home and alerts you to issues
- ✅ Creates complex automations from simple descriptions

**How it works (3 steps):**
1. Connect HomeClaw to Home Assistant or your smart devices
2. Tell it what you want in plain English
3. It handles the automation and control

## USE CASES SECTION

**Headline:** Built For…

**Home Assistant Users**
"Already have HA running. Add AI on top for natural control."

**Smart Home Beginners**
"Lots of devices, no automation. Help me set up routines."

**Automation Enthusiasts**
"I can write YAML, but AI makes it faster and smarter."

**Homeowners**
"Monitor my home, catch issues, save energy. Make it easy."

## DIFFERENTIATION SECTION

**Headline:** Why HomeClaw?

**Home Assistant Integration**
Works with the most powerful smart home platform. Not another walled garden.

Stop swiping apps. Just say what you want.

**Learns Your Routines**
Observe patterns, suggest automations, get smarter over time.

**Runs Locally**
Your home data stays on your network. Not in the cloud.

**Open Source**
Audit the code. Your home deserves transparency.

## FEATURES SECTION

**Headline:** What You Get

- 🏠 **Device Control** — "Turn off the living room lights"

You keep saying KimiClaw When the correct spelling is: KimiClaw. Please correct the Github and other other references to KimiClaw.
assistant: You're right, my apologies! Let me fix that. The correct spelling is **KimiClaw** (Kimi models from Moonshot AI).

Let me update the GitHubrepo:
assistant: ✅ Fixed! The README now correctly shows **KimiClaw** throughout.

**Note:** The GitHub repo is `github.com/profbernardoj/kimiclaw.co` — the domain name stays the same, but all branding should be **KimiClaw** (not KimiClaw).
