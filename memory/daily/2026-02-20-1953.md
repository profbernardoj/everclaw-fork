## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: 🧑‍🚀 Hey David — fresh session, mind clear. What are we working on today?

To send an image back, prefer the message tool (media/path/filePath). If you must inline, use MEDIA:https://example.com/image.jpg (spaces ok, quote if needed) or a safe relative path like MEDIA:./image.jpg. Avoid absolute paths (MEDIA:/...) and ~ paths — they are blocked for security. Keep caption in the text body.

[Signal EverClaw Contributor id:+14432859111 +1m Fri 2026-02-20 13:05 CST] You are having an issue here is the context. How To Fix OpenClaw "Device Token Mismatch" Error (Quick Fix) Feb 16, 2026 · 3 min read · 11 Comments If you’re running OpenClaw and suddenly start seeing this: gateway closed (1008): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token) Don’t panic. I spent way too long on this today. Here’s the fix so you don’t have to. The Symptom After updating to v2026.2.15, openclaw gateway status started showing: RPC probe: failed gateway closed (1008): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token) openclaw doctor — didn’t detect it openclaw gateway restart — same error Deleting device identity files and re-pairing — still broken Multiple reboots — nope The Cause OpenClaw stores a gateway auth token in two places: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json — under gateway.auth.token The service file that keeps the gateway running in the background — as the OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN environment variable The service file location depends on your OS: OS Service file Linux (systemd) ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service macOS (launchd) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist (or legacy com.openclaw.gateway.plist) At some point (likely during an update or config change), these two values got out of sync. The CLI reads one token, the gateway process uses the other, and they reject each other. The Fix (Linux) I’m sure an actual fix is coming. For now, you need to make sure that these two auth tokens match. Check it out with (or just ask OpenClaw to reconcile them): # Get the token from openclaw.json grep -A15 '"gateway":' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | grep -A2 '"auth":' | grep '"token":' | sed 's/[^"]*"token": *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/' # Get the token from the systemd service grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~/.config/systemd/user/openclaw-gateway.service If they’re different, that’s your problem. Copy the token from openclaw.json into the systemd service file: # Edit the service file nano ~/.config/systemd/user/openc <file name="7ca71807-38c7-44f7-aae6-0bc0c436bebf" mime="text/plain"> You are having an issue here is the context.

The Fix (macOS) Same idea, different file location and restart commands. Check if they match: # Get the token from openclaw.json grep -A15 '"gateway":' ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json | grep -A2 '"auth":' | grep '"token":' | sed 's/[^"]*"token": *"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/' # Get the token from the launchd plist grep -A1 OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist Note: If you don’t have ai.openclaw.gateway.plist, check for the legacy name: com.openclaw.gateway.plist. You can find yours with: ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ | grep -i openclaw If the tokens don’t match, edit the plist: # Edit the plist nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist # Find the OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN entry and replace the value # with the token from openclaw.json # Unload and reload the service launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist # Verify openclaw gateway status You should see RPC probe: ok.

Why This Happens Best I can tell, OpenClaw rotates or regenerates the gateway token in openclaw.json during certain operations (updates, config changes, doctor --fix), but doesn’t always update the service file (systemd or launchd) to match. At the moment, this is a known issue in version 2026.2.15. Could be fixed tomorrow, but for now this will get you squared away.

assistant: Let me check if we have this token mismatch issue on your Macmini.
assistant: Tokens match, so that's not the problem here. Let me check gatewaystatus:
assistant: Your gateway is healthy — RPC probe: ok, tokens match. 

Is this something you're running into on a different machine, or are you sharing this for the ClawBox deployment docs?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1771614772856",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

Yes its an issue on my Macmini.
assistant: Hmm, weird — my check just now shows tokens match and RPC probe is ok. What symptom are you seeing? Is it intermittent, or happening when you do something specific?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1771614884251",
  "sender": "+14432859111"
}
```

The gateway will not load on the Mac mini. http://127.0.0.1:18789/chat?session=agent%3Amain%3Amain Still shows this error disconnected (1008): unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)
assistant: Web interface is failing but CLI probe succeeds? Let me dig deeper — there might be multiple plist files or a browser cachingissue.
assistant: Tokens match perfectly. Let me check the gateway logs to see what's actually failing when the browser connects:
