## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: venice/claude-opus-4-6 (default: mor-gateway/glm-5) · 🔑 api-key VENICE…u4QaUV (venice:key1)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
