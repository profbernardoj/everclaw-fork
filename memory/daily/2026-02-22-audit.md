## Recommendations

1. **Stubs (branding/, consulting/, content/, crm/)** — Review if still needed. If placeholder for future work, document in MEMORY.md. If abandoned, clean up.
2. **Large clones (claw-repos/, everclaw-fork/, everclaw-template/)** — 49MB combined. Add to .gitignore if not tracked. Consider removing stale copies.
3. **everclaw-key-api/** — 32MB with node_modules. Should node_modules be gitignored?
4. **node_modules/** — Should definitely be in .gitignore
5. **mission-control/** — Undocumented, needs review of contents
