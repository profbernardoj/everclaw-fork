## Conversation Summary

assistant: No new deployment triggered yet. GitHub Pages deploys from the `docs/` folder on push — it might take a few minutes for GitHub to queue the build. Let me wait a bit longer:
assistant: Pages build hasn't been triggered yet — GitHub sometimes has a delay. Let me check once more:
assistant: Still showing v0.7. The Pages deploy may not have triggered. Let me check if the Pages source is configured correctly:
assistant: Config is correct — Pages deploys from `main` branch `/docs` folder. The deploy should trigger automatically. GitHub might just have a longer queue right now. Let me check if there's a new run:
assistant: Commit is there (17:55 UTC = 11:55 CST). The Pages build just hasn't been triggered yet — sometimes GitHub has delays. Let me manually trigger a Pages rebuild:

[Wed 2026-02-11 12:07 CST] Thanks. Reviewing the Github profile for EverClaw it still uses the term "Unlimited" in the "About" section for the repository. Lets change that text to: "Decentralized AI inference for OpenClaw agents. Powered by Morpheus AI. Stake MOR, access Kimi K2.5 + 10 models, never run out of inference."

assistant: Done. Also — the Pages build I triggered just before should be propagating now. Let me check:
assistant: Both updates are live — repo description updated and website now showing v0.8.0. 🎉
user: [Wed 2026-02-11 13:01 CST] Great job. Alright my friend you Venice Diem credits are about spent for the day. So lets do some more work to use them up and hopefully your Router and fall backs can keep the work going when it switches to Kimi 2.5 on Morpheus. Lets start researching OpenClaw and how we will wrap the EverClaw skills into a new version of OpenClaw we will call SmartAgent.

assistant: 


assistant: Now let me synthesize all this research into a coherent architecture document:
assistant: OK David, here's what I found from deep-diving into OpenClaw's architecture and the SmartAgentProtocol org. I've written up a full strategy doc at `smartagent/ARCHITECTURE.md`, but here's the TL;DR:

**The big insight: We don't need to fork OpenClaw (yet).**

OpenClaw is MIT-licensed, very well architected, and has clean extension points. Our best path is an **installer-first approach**:

**SmartAgent = OpenClaw + Everclaw + pre-configured defaults + one-line install**

The install flow would be:
1. `curl -fsSL https://smartagent.xyz/install.sh | bash`
2. Script installs Node, OpenClaw, Everclaw, runs `bootstrap-gateway.mjs`
3. User gets free inference immediately via Morpheus API Gateway
4. Agent opens in WebChat and guides the user through personalization
5. Progressive upgrade: free Gateway → own API key → Venice → MOR staking

**Key architecture decisions:**
- **Primary model: `mor-gateway/kimi-k2.5`** (free, no API key needed)
- **WebChat as default surface** (no phone setup friction)
- **Pre-configured SOUL.md/AGENTS.md/BOOTSTRAP.md** tuned for SmartAgent
- **No fork maintenance burden** — we track upstream OpenClaw automatically

**For the repo (`SmartAgentProtocol/smartagent`):**
- Branch protection, PR templates, CI/CD from day one
- Install script tested on clean machines (macOS + Linux)
- Squash merges for clean history

**Open questions for you:**
1. Repo name — `smartagent`? Or reuse the existing `Smart-Agent-Chat` repo?
2. Domain for the install script/website?
3. Pin to a specific OpenClaw version or track latest?
4. Branding — new logo or reuse Morpheus wings?

Ready to start building the repo and installer whenever you give the green light on these decisions.

assistant:  Yes, I'm back online. The Venice credits ran out and we hit the cooldown cascade I fixed earlier — both Venice and Morpheus went into extended cooldown, which left me offline for a bit. The gateway just came back up.

I'm on `morpheus/kimi-k2.5` now via our local proxy (the Morpheus P2P node is working fine). Ready to continue on SmartAgent whenever you are.

Quick status:
- **Everclaw v0.8** shipped — website showing v0.8.0, repo description updated
- **SmartAgent architecture** doc written — I analyzed OpenClaw's internals (MIT, 185k stars, very clean TypeScript architecture) and mapped out the installer-first strategy
- **Next:** Create the `SmartAgentProtocol/smartagent` repo with branch protection, PR templates, CI/CD, and start building the install script

What's the call on those open questions:
1. **Repo name** — `smartagent` or reuse `Smart-Agent-Chat`?
2. **Domain** — smartagent.xyz? Something under mor.org?
3. **Pin OpenClaw version** or track latest?

Want me to start building while you think on those, or do you want to lock in the decisions first?
