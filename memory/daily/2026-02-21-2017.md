## Conversation Summary

assistant: All done. **14 repos updated and pushed, 0 failures.**

The 19 skipped were flavor repos that don't have `.git` initialized yet (they're local copies waiting for website setup). All the repos that have git remotes got the v5 guardian pushed:

**Core repos (4):** everclaw-template, everclaw, everclaw-fork, smartagent
**Skills (1):** skills/everclaw
**Flavors with git (9):** officeclaw.org, emailclaw.org, friendclaw.xyz, bookingclaw.org, familyclaw.org, briefingclaw.com, officeclaw.ai, investclaw.ai, homeclaw.org

Great, next I’d like to develop a skill called “three shifts” where the agent proposes a list of tasks to be approved by the user, three times a day. The default configuration would be 6 AM, 2 PM and 10 PM the users’s local time. Each shift should try to encompass what can be accomplished in eight hour shift. That is contextually relevant to the user.
assistant: Good — no prior work on this. Let me think through the design before building.

**Objective:** A "three-shifts" skill where the agent proposes a task list 3 times/day (6 AM, 2 PM, 10 PM local time), each covering an 8-hour shift of contextually relevant work for user approval.

**Design plan:**
1. `SKILL.md` — Core instructions for how the agent generates shift plans
2. `scripts/shift-planner.sh` — Lightweight trigger script for cron
3. `references/shift-config.md` — Default config, customization guide
4. The skill should generalize beyond the existing night-shift skill (which only covers 10 PM–6 AM)

Let me build it:
assistant: Now let me verify the skill structure:
assistant: Clean structure. Let me remove the empty scripts/ dir since we don't need it — the cron jobs trigger the agent directly:
assistant: Skill is built. Here's what you've got:

**`skills/three-shifts/`**
- `SKILL.md` (143 lines) — Core instructions for generating, presenting, and executing shift plans
- `references/config.md` (91 lines) — Default schedule, customization options, approval behaviors, state tracking

**How it works:**
- 3 cron jobs fire at 6 AM, 2 PM, and 10 PM (configurable)
- Each gathers context from memory, calendar, email, git status, and the previous shift's handoff
- Generates a prioritized task list (P1/P2/P3) capped at ~7 hours of work
- Sends the plan to you for approval — you can approve, modify, pick specific tasks, or skip
- After approval, executes tasks in priority order and logs everything
- At shift end, writes a handoff for the next shift

**Shift character:**
- **Morning** — Comms, decisions, meeting prep (you're most available)
- **Afternoon** — Deep work: coding, writing, building
- **Night** — Autonomous: research, drafts, maintenance (no external comms, cancelled if you don't approve by 10:30 PM)

**Supersedes** the old night-shift skill (night shift is now one of three).

Want me to set up the three cron jobs now to activate it?

Yeah, go ahead and set up the three Crown jobs and activate it run an afternoon shift job right now is a test
assistant: I see the existing Night Shift Planning cron job. Let me disable it and create the three new ones:
assistant: All three crons are live. Now let me fire the afternoon shift as a test:
assistant: The cron run timed out — the GLM-5 model via mor-gateway is struggling with latency today (we saw the 37+ second responses earlier). The job likely fired but the response didn't complete within the 180s window. Let me check if it actually delivered to Signal, and then retry with a faster model:
assistant: Good, now also update the morning and night to use `morpheus/glm-4.7-flash` (my direct edit may not have persisted through the restart):
assistant: All three jobs now on `morpheus/glm-4.

Yeah, go ahead and set up the three Crown jobs and activate it run an afternoon shift job right now is a test
assistant: All three crons are set up and models are fixed. Let me fire the afternoon shift test now:
assistant: The cron CLI is timing out waiting for the response, but the job is likely running in the background. The model issue is that morning and night still have `mor-gateway/glm-5` which is slow. Let me fix all three via the stop-edit-start approach that worked before, then just generate the afternoon shift plan directly from this session:
