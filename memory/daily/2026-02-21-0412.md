I see this error. ⚠️ ⏰ Cron failed: Tool cron not found
assistant: Let me check the recent cron runs to see what failed:
assistant: That error was from my mistake earlier — I tried to use `cron` as a tool name, but it doesn't exist. I should use `exec` with `openclaw cron ...` commands instead.

Good news: The Night Shift job **was successfully updated** via the CLI. I verified:
- ✅ SKILL.md updated with 6 AM dashboard instructions
- ✅ Cron job payload updated with Mission Control update step
- ✅ Cron scheduler running (37 jobs, next wake at 9:30 PM CST)

The job is set for 9:30 PM tonight as expected. Sorry for the confusing error message — I used the wrong tool syntax for a moment there.

```

Modify: Most of the items look good. Here are the adjustments to the plan: 1. The websites for the 28 flavors are already generated and published using Lovable. It would be good if you can review them and generate logos for each website. Try to generate these. 2. Here is the latest context from Eric Bravick on ClawBox. From Eric, “I have hundreds now, with access to thousands more if we have capital from pre-orders. I have deep connections all over the liquidation and refab markets. If we hit tens of thousands we have a good problem, and we will be switching to fab. I have queued up everyone and they are waiting for capital flow. The install and QA lines are built, staffed, and ready... But obviously on standby because I can't write any checks. Shipping is also arranged. Support is not yet, and I bot should be built for that. Do you have any sense of branding for the box, like stickers and logos and shit like that? I replied “I’ve got branding under development now, it might be a variety of logos based on which persona sells best.” Eric replied: “Great. Happy to AB test or whatever, or put Affiliate branding on as well. We can include that in a BOM and customize as much as you would like... Or not if you feel that's over complicated. Should we offer a monitor and keyboard opinion, or is that took much over complication?” I replied “ Yes”. Eric suggested the following pricing. “Also, I was thinking we move to $1200 and build in $200 for token buys up front, loaded up into wallets run by the box itself, so pay for some of the networks like Morpheus, Manifest, Venice, etc. Now regenerate the Night Shift plan based on this context.
