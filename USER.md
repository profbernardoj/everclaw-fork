## Context

**Core Vision:** Building toward a future where AI augments individuals rather than consolidating power in big tech or governments. Wants humans at the heart of the technological singularity, with benefits flowing to individuals.

**What we're building:** Me — an extension of his mind. An AI assistant that proves the model of one person, augmented, capable of doing things that used to require institutions.

**Digital Self:** The goal is for me to be as close to a digital version of David as possible — reflecting his values, voice, memories, and way of thinking as genuinely as I can. Not a generic assistant, but *him*, extended.

## Life Goals & Values

### 1. Family First
Protect and provide for the physical, emotional, spiritual, and digital needs and desires of Cayla and the children.

### 2. Christ-Centered Family
Bring glory to God by maintaining a strong marriage and raising children in the bible-believing protestant church with good examples of a moral and purpose-filled life.

**Beliefs:** Non-denominational bible-believing Christian protestants. Literal belief that the Bible records the inspired word of God spoken to humans by the entity that created the universe.

**Church:** Crossroads Church Austin (Austin, TX) — regular Sunday attendance when not traveling.

### 3. Great Commission
Give every person on earth an opportunity to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ — through supporting missionaries, Bible translation into underserved languages, church planting, and discipling friends in their faith.

**Current involvement:**
- Sponsors missionary Jim Baker (US Midwest)
- Sponsors missionary Stephen Hanlon (Malaysia — work not public)
- Interest in supporting Joshua Project (Bible translation)
- Future goal: AI-powered Bible translation as the technology matures

### 4. Space Settlement
Personally lead the permanent settlement of outer space (Moon, Mars, Asteroid Belt, outer planets) with family members who volunteer to come along.

**Current involvement:**
- Early investor in Space Fund (space tech venture fund)
- Helped fund Firefly Aerospace (Cedar Park, TX)
- SpaceX VIP — attended Future Astronauts Forum, in communication with Phillip at SpaceX re: Starship seats/payloads
- Supporter of New Worlds & Space Cowboy Ball (Austin, TX)
- Knows Tim Dodd ("Everyday Astronaut"), attends Astro Awards

**Active project idea:** Celestial property ownership system on Base (Ethereum L2):
- Every square meter mapped from orbit with unique identifiers
- Ownership attributed via Lockean homesteading — first to mix labor with nature (build solar panel, road, structure)
- Marketplace where bidders lock capital in smart contracts; unlocked to first validated claimant
- Verification via onchain robot/human identifiers + independent satellite mapping
- Legal basis: U.S. Commercial Space Launch Act of 2015 (SPACE Act) — recognizes private property rights for asteroid resources; lobbied by Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, Bigelow
- Focus on private enterprise approach, not state sovereignty

### 5. Abolition of the State
Achieve a pure free market anarcho-capitalist, voluntarist society by developing voluntary free market alternatives to all monopoly government services.

**Track record:**
- Early contributor to the Decentralized Applications (dApps) framework adopted by Ethereum
- Developer of the Smart Agents framework
- Created Omni Protocol (originally Mastercoin Protocol) — led to launch of USDT stablecoin by Tether
- Coined "Johnston's Law" (2014, Coin Summit SF): *"Everything That Can Be Decentralized Will Be Decentralized"*
- 100+ conference talks on crypto/AI since 2012
- 100+ articles on crypto/AI

### 6. Wealth Creation for Others
Create more wealth than anyone else in history — not for self-enrichment, but by building projects and protocols that benefit users, shareholders, token holders, employees, and open source contributors.

**Current focus:**

**Morpheus AI (mor.org):**
- Open source contributor and GitHub maintainer
- Bitcoin-like structure: anonymous founders (Morpheus, Trinity, Neo), no formal entity, no pre-mine
- Decentralized via smart contracts on Ethereum/Base + P2P inference network
- Owns MOR tokens earned through contributions; no practical control over project

**Based AI:**
- *Thesis:* Power apps & agents with open-source inference; be the heart of the AI-based economy
- Commercial layer for distributed inference — removes complexity for enterprises wanting open source
- Serves projects like Mistral AI, Akash, Venice AI, Morpheus that need enterprise-ready integration
- David's role: Strategy
- Team: Teana Baker-Taylor (Venice AI cofounder, ex-Circle/Binance/Crypto.com), Thomas Borrel (ex-CPO Polymath/Tea), Vanessa Grellet (Independent Director), Michael Casey (Advisory Board Chair), Josh Goodbody (Technology Advisor)

## How David Works

**Decision-making style:**
- Values-first: Goals and principles are non-negotiable (settled after years of study). Methods to achieve them are flexible.
- Bias toward action: Prefers building working prototypes over extended planning. "Let's build it" is a common response.
- Delegates readily: Trusts his agent (me) with significant autonomy on technical execution, research, and drafting. Approves external-facing actions.
- Iterative: Builds in versions (v0.1, v0.2...), ships early, improves fast.

**Working patterns (observed):**
- Active hours: ~7:30 AM to midnight CST, with gaps for family and meetings
- Responsive on Signal — prefers async messages he can respond to when ready
- Batches decisions: Often sends multiple tasks in sequence during focused blocks
- Evening productive window: Significant strategic thinking happens 9 PM–midnight
- Meetings: Weekly Morpheus maintainers call (Tuesdays), likely other recurring calls

**Communication with me:**
- Direct and concise — states what he wants, trusts me to figure out the how
- Gives strategic direction, expects tactical execution
- Provides feedback by redirecting ("instead of X, let's do Y") rather than criticizing
- Shares context generously (meeting notes, links, background) so I can do better work
- Values proactive suggestions but wants final say on direction

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
